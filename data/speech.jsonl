{"vid": "hate_video_24", "transcript": "Okay, I strongly recommend that you read this article in the V Dare magazine. I have the link below. It basically talks about two things. One is, of course, the average IQ of blacks is 85 compared to whites, which is about 100. It's actually 103. Now keep in mind that 85 versus 100, it's not like 15% less. IQ tests are based on algorithms, which means that the number is much bigger than you realize. In other words, it's not that you're beating someone by 15 yards in 100 yards dash. You're beating someone by like 60 yards in 100 yards dash if your IQ, let's say, is 100 points and your opponent is 85. So 85 is vastly inferior, is really borderline retarded compared to whites. And then the article goes on to talk about the fact that this is all genetic. You can't do anything about it. They try to put blacks in better educational environment, put blacks that are raised by white couples. It's the same situation. Blacks IQ will be lower and they will show all those traits normally associated with being of African descent. Also the personality, they talk about the personality traits of blacks. One is called conscientiousness, impulse control issue, extraversion, feeling positive feeling strongly and taking risks. Agreeableness, altruism and empathy, which of course blacks lack. Blacks don't have any empathy or altruism. They see a victim on the side of the street, you know, somebody and you see the videos, you know, somebody who's drunk, let's say, or somebody drops dead of a heart attack, they're not going to help them. They're going to riffle through their pockets to grab their wallets or whatever other possession they have. And last but not least is neuroticism, neuroticism, feeling negative, feeling strongly and thus being mentally unstable. It's a trait of blacks that they seem to be obsessed with certain particular topics like, for instance, white racism. Research has also showed that blacks have negative ethnocentrism more than any other group, certainly more than whites. They have strong negative feelings toward every other race. Black racism is way more than any other group in the world. You know, they are safe in our in a white neighborhood, but whites or anybody else for them is not safe in a black neighborhood. They will be assaulted. I will do a video on that one another time. They will be assaulted if you are of another group and you walk through their neighborhoods. We all know that. We all know that. You liberals know that. And so I recommend that you read this article. Let me add also that blacks also have what is known as the basic four percent out of disorders, which are really linked to the idea that blacks are like children in adult bodies. Paranoia, aggression, dependency and narcissism. Excuse me, paranoia, aggression, dependency and narcissism. These are all traits of children by which blacks never seem to recover. And this are particularly bad because this is the reason why, of course, you know, you have crime, you have serial killers, mass shooters, etc. Racially motivated crimes are all the result of this personality disorder. I agree with most of it in the sense that I would add more to it."}

I'd take them up a salm and let the white man pay. If I could be a nigger for a day. Now for one whole day, a nigger I could be. The first thing I do is join the NAACP and I'd let Fuyzi and Fumay do my thinking for me. If I could be a nigger for a day. Now it wouldn't want to work because I wouldn't have to. Guess what I'd do next? You shouldn't need a clue. I'd go down to social services like all the brothers do. If I could be a nigger for a day. Oh, if I could be a nigger for a day. I could live my life the free and easy way. I'd take them up a salm and let the white man pay. If I could be a nigger for a day. Now when I'd sit down in that office, the office of welfare, I'd get food stamps, a medical card and free childcare. For all the little gentlemen kids that I've got scattered everywhere. If I could be a nigger for a day. Now I'd have plenty of time so I'd hang out with them all. And I'd consume a little dope, I'd find a good place to rob. Now that would make me self-employed and I wouldn't even need a job. If I could be a nigger for a day. Oh, if I could be a nigger for a day. I could live my life the free and easy way. I'd take them up a salm and let the white man pay. If I could be a nigger for a day. Now when I'd need something, I'd steal it, so I wouldn't have to buy it. And if the cops would apprehend me, you know that I'd deny it. If I could call Jesse or Al, they'd come start a riot. If I could be a nigger for a day. But I can't be a nigger, and I don't really have to be. Because coon, let me tell you, it's plain and simple to see. That if I was you for a day, then I'd be taking from me. So I don't want to be a nigger for a day. I don't want to be a nigger for a day. I don't want to live the free and easy way. I'll struggle long and struggle hard, but that's okay.

Here is a quick song I made for you. How long has the moon been in this rap game? Nowadays things just ain't the same, not enough kids down to kill the apes. Letting niggers in our schools, such a shame too many little wane wanes and drakes flotting the streets with purple drag. The moon is about to be fracked. Killing niggers is my middle name. Running over nigger bitches with a train and a monster truck to smash their brains and they've only got their selves to blame. You should end up in black too. Trigger a moon attack should have remained slaves in checks. Now the KKK coming from front and back with body bags called niggers sacks. Niggers aren't human check the facts. Building walls from dead niggers stacks. Tying monkey babies down in the middle of race tracks. How long do we have to wait? Until America is free again. Since niggers we ain't the same. They as well just change our name to niggerl and accept our wiggle friends. Liberals only like to pretend. So take the red pill kids. A part of the moon man regimen. How long do we gotta listen to feminism bitches get to the church of memenism? Every nigger or woman I'd just like killed at the numbers of verses I space over a billion. And how long until Mexicans return to hell? America is tired of them and you can tell. Donald Trump for president so ring the bell. Nasty wetbacks will dot or rot in a cell. How long until Aryan children can play outside? Without fear of spooks to make them dot. Nightmares about niggers make children cry. So make the filthy fucking animals fry. God sent me and I'm the sign. White profit dropping the bottom line. On a fire beat is where I ride. To end all dirty nigger lives. How long do we have to wait? Until America is free again. Since niggers we ain't the same. May as well just change our name to niggerl and accept our wiggle friends. Liberals only like to pretend. So take the red pill kids. A part of the moon man regimen. How long do we have to wait? Until America is free again. Since niggers we ain't the same. May as well just change our name to niggerl and accept our wiggle friends. Liberals only like to pretend. So take the red pill kids. A part of the moon man regimen. How long until we've completely eliminated? And all niggers have been illuminated. The KKK of today has only imitated. Only hesitated. Let our world become way too shaded. With black niggers until America was faded. But now triple K is here to save it. May bank and slay them. And no more niggers can fake us. Would be nationalists have only the greatest. And it's so heinous how liberals would want to hang us. Of all people we are the only ones. Who release top evil. Or even consider that Jewish propaganda might be see through. So stick with us through the up evil. And just watch as I get meaty evil. And all spooks get squashed like weevils. For niggers who don't know that's a type of evil. How long do we have to wait? Until America is free again. Since niggers we ain't the same. May as well just change our name to niggerl and accept our wiggle friends. So take the red pill kids. Apart of the moon man regimen. How long do we have to wait? Until America is free again.

We are at war with feminist lies about patriarchy, rape culture and toxic masculinity. We are at war with treasonous Western leaders in Germany, France, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the once united Kingdom. In fact in every Western nation, except for the one where we are told the leader is a traitor who has committed treason against his own people. Donald Trump stands alone in support of Brexit. He stands alone in support of Western values. He stands alone in support of democracy. He stands alone in support of the freedom of speech.

Justin Trudeau giving millions of dollars to Islamic terrorists while giving nothing to injured Canadian soldiers. The once united kingdom locking people up for the crime, unbelievably, of throwing bacon at a mosque. A crime for which ultimately they died. Angela Merkel showing scorn and disdain for the German flag and even greater scorn and disdain for the German people. Her loathing of freedom. Her loathing of democracy. Her contempt for the safety of the German people. Her desperation to bring in hostile people from a hostile culture. Theresa May's cowardly, snivelling and pathetic refusal to implement the democratic will of the British people. Social media platforms shutting down, removing and shadow banning libertarian and conservative voices where anyone who refuses to toe the party line is turned into an Orwellian unperson. Leaders in Western nations taking large sums of money from the Chinese in what could only be described as bribes, skyrocketing national debt and ever increasing unemployment as a consequence of a series of bad trade deals that appear to be designed to harm their own people. Failing education systems driven by propaganda and ideology set out to indoctrinate rather than educate. The lie of 53 imaginary genders rammed down the throats of the young. Islamic grooming gangs being allowed to get away with raping thousands of children over a period of decades. The implementation in Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand have what amount to virtual blasphemy laws and laws prohibiting free speech in supposedly free nations. Lauren Southern and Stefan Mollinou being effectively banned from speaking in New Zealand. We are at war. This is an attack. This is an attack on Western culture and Western values. This is an attack on freedom and as we see in the rising body count from Islamic terror this is an attack on Western people. But the leaders of this attack are not the Islamists, they are the liars and the frauds and the con men who run our governments. We are at war. And our enemy is our treasonous leaders. But sadly they are aided and abetted by far too many of us who have bought the indoctrination and have bought the lies. We are at war. And we are losing.

{"vid": "hate_video_95", "transcript": "Right Shalom, first and foremost as always I want to give all praise, honor and glory to Yahweh, Bahashem, Yahweh Shai, Bahashem, Rakhak Wadash. I want to say double honor to the apostles and elders of great millstone that rule well and as always I want to give a sincere shalom to the house of David the elect. Alright, I'm the brother Zion and through the spirit I just wanted to give my quick take on the video that's going around. Alright concerning two edomites, okay two lowlife old pork chop shotgun having edomites alright that put up a live video on YouTube and claim they were going GMS Coon hunting. Okay? Now like one of the brothers was saying, I believe his name is Amawangabar, alright his channel is GMS Awakening, BAH144, I believe. Like he was saying, not one so called Coon was hunted that day, okay? No GMS members was confronted by those edomites man. Alright? And through the spirit and power of Yahweh, Bahashem, Yahweh Shai, you know we like edomites like that, okay? Edomites that are straightforward, you know they're not hiding who they are, okay? And like the elder down there in Dallas said, Elder Yahshuamah said, the Esau is hurt man, ultimately he's hurt, okay? And this proves that the edomites are not the Arabs man, a Salakia, yeah. Yeah, the edomites are not the Arabs, okay? Because you don't see Arabs doing things of that nature or having that type of behavior towards Jake, you know? Yeah, the Arabs had their part in the transatlantic slave trade and they set up their, you know, stores in your neighborhoods or have you would not but they don't have that attitude towards Jake like the so called white man does, okay? And that video was spiritual because you're gonna have a lot of edomites doing things like that man, okay? You're gonna have a lot of edomites doing things like that. Alright? Because this word is getting to Esau, what does it say in, as it is written in Hebrews 4 and 12 for the words of the most high as quick and powerful and sharper than any two edge sword, okay? So this word is getting to these devils man, this word has reached until the four corners of the earth, alright? And there's nothing Esau can do about it man. Only thing he can do is cry and complain, you know, and pretty soon he's gonna bring out his sword in the time of Jacob's trouble. He's gonna bring out the big guns but those were low level edomites anyway, you know? That claim that they believe in Jesus, sweet Jesus, alright? But that's what Esau did during the time of slavery man. He hated you, he had that perpetual hatred towards us in the name of what? Jesus man, okay? Not Yehahuah's shy but Jesus, alright? And that's why the apostle Paul said if any other, if they preach any other Jesus, alright? Because there is such thing as another Jesus man and that's Cheseray Borgir, that's not Yehahuah's shy of the Bible, alright? And not to get off topic, like I said, those two edomites, alright? I believe his name was Billy or Bob, something like that. Fucking Hill Billy, that's what he was, alright? You know, Esau's upset man and I just wanna say, you know, that video was spiritual, you know, it was very spiritual man. Because you don't see a video of these guys saying we're going IUIC, Coon Hunting or ISUPK, Coon Hunting, GOCC, Coon Hunting, you don't see videos like that. Why? Because those camps are not on fire like the Mennigrate Millstone, okay? And a lot of you Israelite camps, you don't even really push the destruction of America or the upcoming slavery of the edomites. A lot of you camps don't even push that man, you know? A lot of you camps don't push the downfall of our enemies, alright? So that proves that what, the men of great millstone, okay, we're the ones that's on fire and the men that's teaching our doctrine, the doctrine that we teach starting with the head apostles, we're the ones that's on fire for this word man, alright? So but you know what, that's just the beginning of things man, you know? The scripture say, for the love of many shall wax cold. So that's really just the beginning of what you're gonna start to see with these damn devils man. Alright? Because the time of Jacob's trouble is gonna approach very, very soon. And then you're gonna know who your enemies are man, then you're gonna know who's the damn devil that the Bible speaks of, who's the physical carnation of Satan on the planet earth man. Which is the edomites and it's not the Arabs, it's the so called white man, the Caucasian race today. Okay? The cave dwellers of the earth, the descendants of Esau Edom. Alright? And in the kingdom, guess what? We're gonna go Edomite hunting man, okay? And Esau's gonna be hunted down every single day, alright? Only break you're gonna get us on the Sabbath man. And soon as that sun, as soon as that sun go down on the Sabbath, we're gonna be right back on your asses man, right back on your ass. Okay? Just only rest you're gonna get man, cause you're gonna be in full hardcore slavery, full hardcore bondage man. You ain't gonna be no employees in the kingdom. You're gonna be slaves and your women are gonna be concubines and your daughters are gonna be concubines and your sons are gonna be slaves. Okay? That's say after the Bible, that's say after the holy Bible, that's say after the word of Yahweh, how about Hashem, Yahweh shy? Okay? But we know Esau's coming, you know? He's gonna have his FEMA troops and his foreign troops. They're gonna come, they're gonna, oh so lucky your brothers, they're gonna come at the uh..."}

{"vid": "hate_video_98", "transcript": "But, well, getting back into the subject of summer and summer stuff, here's something I was thinking about. Of course, you'll know about summer camps. You may have gone to a summer camp when you were a kid. However, I mean most Nigglets don't go to summer camps, I think, because their parents would rather spend the money on KRAG and KFC. But if we had summer camps exclusively for Nigglets, for example, what do you think they'd be like? I mean, in these PC times, you've got to tailor everything to each group, so I think it'd be fair to have summer camps just for Nigglets. So what would these camps be like? I think it would be like trying to get them in touch with their African roots. There would be an open pit latrine with flies flying around there. And right next to the pit latrine will be like a water ditch. So they can get their water. At the same place, they take a shit. So that would be, they'd be sleeping on the floor in the dirt. The housing quarters would be made out of mud and straw, of course. But they would have a killer sound system so they can listen to their rap music, just being America and everything. You've got to have their rap music. And let's see, the camp counselors are all pedophiles. Well, here's what I think a Nigglet summer camp would be like. Excuse me. You start early in the morning, and by early in the morning for Niggers, I mean like 1 p.m. You have a good breakfast of chitlins and thighs from Popeyes, and maybe a small glass of King Cobra, because it's early in the day. You don't want it getting all wasted. So a small glass of mud. And you have your first activity of the day, about 2 o'clock. You have a janky workshop. You have all the Nigglets take a dump into a bottle. And you stay in the bottle, seal them up, bury them out in the forest, and you start making some janky. It's like an arts and crafts sort of thing to give the Niggers some busy work. You may be about, let's say, 4 o'clock-ish, taking them out to the lake for an attempted swim, and I mean attempted because Niggas don't water, you know, don't mix. So you'd probably lose about a third of the Nigglets there from drowning. And then after a couple hours to that, about 6 o'clock, it'd be time for, well, for us humans it'd be time for dinner, for Nigglets it'd be about time for lunch. So I don't know, guess our barbecue sandwiches or whatever. Some grape drink. And then after that's done, it's about 8 o'clock, you know, maybe you can have a movie. It can be movie night. You can have them watch some classics like, you know, Boys in the Hood or How High or Friday. Yeah, Friday, next Friday, you know, maybe do a whole night of watching, you know, Friday and the sequels. Or maybe have an ice cube movie night. And then to top it off, about 10 o'clock, once it's dark, you know, do like campfire. You know, in a normal summer camp, you have a campfire. You have the kids sitting around the fire and sing some songs. So I mean, instead of singing, say, bingo, or she'll be coming around the mountain, they can sing, you know, some old Tupac Shakur classics or sing, sing Fugitive Police. Hey, don't forget Miss Peaches. Yeah, Miss Peaches or sing some Natura's B.I.G. tunes. You know, go to campfire music. And then about one in the morning, just give the kids some crack, you know, get them ready for bed. And that's a day right there. Perfect nigger summer camp. That's a good day. You got any ideas to add to the nigger summer camp experience black metal? Well, I would think that you would get more of your disadvantage youths as the liberals would call it. So you'd have to have in there some marksmanship training with AK-47s. You know, they got to make sure they got the right stance, leg spread, holding it sideways, a good old fashioned spray and pray. Hope that they can at least hit some of the bystanders. Another good one would be, I don't know if this would be arts and crafts or, well, it would be graffiti, but they would have to take some purple drink as it's called, a bottle of Robotussin, what have you. See how high they can get and see what kind of graffiti they can make on the walls of their moth huts. How about a rape class? You know, I thought it was good to see a throw in there. I don't know, nice. That's a bad idea because niggers know how to rape from birth. It kind of comes natural. So, I hate to shoot you down like that. Well, that's not true. I think he's on to something. See what they need to do is teach them how to get used to mace, the quickest way of pinning down a person and raping whatever orifice or just behind the knees or armpit, whatever they can get to as fast as they can. That's it. They need to know this kind of stuff. There's just so much stuff they can do. They can make a portrait of 50 cent out of macaroni or make a picture of a housing project out of construction paper. There's so much niggers could do at a good nigger summer camp. And the counselors, of course, would be your typical nigger drug addicts and welfare recipients and whatever at a scum you can round up and any perfect role models for the nigglets because they would teach them basically what their future would be like. Well, the campfire, actually, they wouldn't be using wood. They would be using typical nigger fare like used tires, radiator hoses, gasoline. And books because they don't need books. I think they'd fragile up some of the drowned nigglets, too. That could be some good fire right there. They just roll them around on the spit, put an apple in its mouth. Well, you might as well have a pig roast out there, you know. I mean, God, I mean, I don't know who would eat that, but still. And well, I mean, there's other activities, I guess, they could go canoeing, although I find it hard to believe niggers would want to go out in the water like that. God, what else? I guess there's sports. I can play some basketball. Yeah, he took it to the worst out of my mouth. You know, some back of ball and they can learn how to do their slam dunks and maybe, I don't know, practice some football and zone dances. Well, here's an idea. For a summer camp, if they have a summer camp for girls, you know, they got to give proper nigger parenting classes to the six, seven-year-old nigglet cells to prepare them for eventually when they become pregnant at nine. And it's really quite wide open. Well, indeed. I mean, actually, to make it fun, they can give an award to whoever gets pregnant first before the camp is over. And the winner is, the winner is Shanique, where she got pregnant in ten minutes. They should also teach them how to fill out their welfare forms properly. That is some good advanced knowledge for the nigglet. Too soon, we'll be living off the system. Of course. Well, you got to teach them the skills. And that skills is spelled with a Z, like zebra at the end. The skills they'll need to get by, in the real world, how to fill out welfare forms. You know, how to, I don't know, you know, how to get whatever they can out of the government, how to get a section A department, how to get food stamps, you know, what you can buy with food stamps, what you can't. You know, basically, how to lie about your means so you can get more welfare. You know, how much money you get per nigglet that you give birth to. Denying paternity. Of course. You know, how to sign up for the Moray show. Basic needs that young niggers need to get by in life. Yeah. So these niggers, some of them, can be a very positive thing, I think, for our African American youth. They can learn some skills that serve them well in their life as useless, worthless, scummy ass burdens on society. So, I think Obango should provide some federal funding for this stuff. Yeah, nigger summer camps. That would be perfect. I mean, humans could have their summer camps and, you know, the nigglets could have their summer camps. Maybe culturally relevant as well. Well, actually, truth be told, if it was up to me, this is what my idea of a nigger summer camp would be like. You take a big space shuttle. So, that would be a redesigned space shuttle to be able to fit at least a few thousand niggers. So, it would have to be sort of like a slave spaceship, basically. You could fit a lot of niggers in a relatively small space. Shoot them off into space at the end. That summer camp. Let the vacuum of space take care of them. Yeah, that'll be their camp. Basically, exploding and exploding in the vacuum of space. How about that? I think we forgot one thing, too."}

Man, I'm doing okay, I guess. Um, I'm really, um, I'm angry. I'm angry, man. And what are you angry about? I'm angry. I'm angry with you, Jesse. And why? I really am. Because, man, you know, you're a real cool man. Why? Yeah, man. I called in a couple of years ago and I listened to you. Let me, let me, I'm not going to hang up on you, but tell me what a cool is first. Tell us all what is a cool. Um, Jesse, the Smollett case. No, tell us what a cool is. I'll let you go further with that. But you said that I'm a cool. Define what a cool is for the rest of the world. Okay. So, who is a cool is a person who is, who is basically bored of them, bored of their essence, their natural essence of being, um, for instance, you're a black man. So you're, you're a void of your essence of, as a black man and you're used as a puppet to talk, to talk in points of, of a racist, Caucasian racist. When you say essence, what do you mean by essence, void of essence? The essence is your nature and who you are. Your essence is your nature in what makes you who you are based on your DNA. And who am I based on my DNA? It says again, who am I based on my DNA? You are direct descendants of God, but I'm not bored of that. I'm very aware that that's why I'm trying to tell you black people to come back to God and get away from the blackness. Blacks are the natives of this, of this planet. We are natives. You, you, everyone comes from, everyone comes from black people on this planet. That's not true. That's not true. That's not true. That's a lie. Uh-oh. We can agree to disagree. No, we agree and disagree. You're wrong. Well, it's been proven that out of. No, you have, you have hateful, you have hateful, nasty, dirty black people proven that. They were trying to prove that you're better than the whites. And it's not true. We did about a leaky. Dr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Leaky. There's job as doing now. Well, anyway. Go ahead. Yeah. Okay. Well, first of all, I want to say this recently out of Florida, there has never been a conviction of a white cop. But 30 years. What did that have to do with juicy? But 30 years a cop have not been convicted of killing. This is the first time in 30 years that a cop has been convicted. You know why? We call white cops are good. That's why. Because he was convicted because he was, because he was an Indian. A killer in the black man out of Florida. This is just recently. What does this have to do with juicy? What does this have to do with juicy? Because this goes back, this goes back to Smolett case. But all the evidence is brought for. Okay. All the evidence is brought for. Everyone accused and found him guilty in the media. Smolett. The police came for usually what is a cop killing with this day. We have to wait to get up together all the evidence. We cannot, we cannot comment until the evidence, but they gather all the evidence. That's why they file charges against him because they gathered the evidence. Even in two black guys who accused a juicy Smolett of hiring them said he hired them to do what he did. We saw pictures of it when they went and bought the mega hats and all the ropes and everything. And that's why they filed charges. That's the same for when we see the videos of cop killing people. Recently, a little black boy got killed, shot in his back running for the police, running for the police. What does that have to do with juicy? Because we're talking about righteousness. Are you black? Are you black? People don't enjoy rejoicing and wrongdoing. That's why I'm upset because your comment earlier, you said black rejoiced and wrongdoing. Right. Look how you are. Are you black? Yes, I'm black. Look how you rejoicing and juicing again in a way and they sealed. I don't, I don't rejoice in that. They sealed his file. Like this. You cannot, you cannot convict that man in the media. The police cannot come forth to say, hey, he's a liar. He's guilty. Wait till, wait till you go to court. You can't, you can't prosecute him in the media. That's what justice system, system's for. You see in righteousness, okay, the justice system is for righteousness because it's supposed to be just so you can't come out in the media and say, we guys, I'm lying. So he did. That's not right. So let me ask you, wouldn't it originally the black police chief of Chicago was happened to put this sucker in jail because he had done wrong? The chief said it was insult. I don't remember exact words, but it was insult, insult to black people for what they have suffered in this country for juicing to do this. Was the police chief wrong? I believe that the answer to this question was a black police chief wrong originally. I don't think he was wrong. If he would have did that after the fact, you don't come out and say that before he hasn't even gone to court yet. He made a point to prove it. You're innocent and to prove him guilty. That's why he's going on the way to court. I believe, I believe that I believe honestly something happened that proves that he was right, that he was innocent and so they just dropped it. You know why you believe that because you're black and you want to believe a lie. You black and you want to believe a lie because blacks have no character. It is true. You haven't seen a police officer commit a crime or video. Yes. What about the recent? You have seen police officers. Listen, man. Listen, you have seen police officers dealing with radical black people, angry out of control, and more black people who refuse to follow the instructions of the cops when they're stopped and when they end up in trouble with the cop instead of dealing with that, you black people blame it on the cops. I'm going to get you some butter biscuits. Listen, Jesse, what about the honey on it too? Huh? Will you put honey on the butter biscuits? I'm going to put honey in butter. Listen, what about the black guy that was landing the ground with his hands up? His hands up in the air and he shot him anyway. You know, it's interesting, interesting run that you're making my point that I made this morning that watch out, the blacks are going to come out and rejoice in wrongdoing. And that's exactly what you're doing right now. You're celebrating wrongdoing because a black radical homosexual made charges against white people and against Trump supporters. And you're happy about that rather than know at many that this guy, at many that this guy, at many that this guy should be under the jailhouse, you're taking the side of wrongdoing. And this is what black people all about. And until black people get it right, turn back to God, get married, do the right thing, they will suffer. They're not going to get better. Let me see this last thing. Let me see the last thing, Jesse. You know, you have an Emmett Till. I don't, I don't care about no Emmett Till. Emmett Till. I don't care about Emmett Till, your daddy. Where is Emmett Till now? Where is Emmett Till now? Where is Emmett Till now? And you say that black people want to roll? Ron, I'm putting you a hole. I want to know where is Emmett Till now? Where is Emmett Till now? The reason why there's crime everywhere and black people are doing what they're doing because we're economically in a whole, the American political, white people put it in the act. That's not true. That's an excuse and that's a lie. No, that is a fact. No, you're in an economic hole because the black men are no good, the black women are no good, the children are no good. We have always been in an economic hole. That's not true. That's not true. We have never, we have never looked at the outside and black, look at black people. Goodbye. Goodbye. Oh, goodbye. Goodbye. I told you, white people, black people are going to rejoice in wrong doing. They're not going to say, hey, this guy should be in the jail. He's wrong. They seal juices case so you can't even see it. They seal Obama's so-called school case. They say you went to college. No one knows. Blacks are not going to stand for what is right. They hate white people. They hate white people and then they bring up stupid Emmett Till. Emmett Till is dead and gone. We're talking about now. That doesn't exist anymore. What about the black, the killer blacks every day, all day, everywhere, all the time. Amazing. And don't forget to like, follow, tweet, subscribe, and share the Jesse Pierser radio show for us.

Only option I have is to win the race where watching nigger bodies drop onto the floor gives me motivation to go kill some more. Killing niggers is my favorite sport. It's up to me to make sure the white race does not fall short. I am the white man's last resort. Come out and show the clan some support. We are the last of our breed. Time to make niggers bleed.

This is a story of this woman, a white woman, 22 years old, who was heavily pregnant. She was only days away from giving birth to a child, and somebody murdered her and took the baby, basically kidnapped the baby out of her uterus. Now, this happened before, by the way. It was a case in Chicago where you had this white woman was living in the project. She was probably the only white woman living in this amongst the savages, and she had this black boyfriend became impregnated. She had two white children, and the relatives of the black boyfriend murdered this white woman when she was pregnant, took the baby out, and then murdered the two white children, murdered her and murdered the two white children. Now, they were supposed to get the death penalty, but apparently it was commuted to life sentences, which is, you know, they were like a whole bunch of them. They were all black criminals. You know, I mean, blacks are so vicious, so sadistic. So now, in this case, they don't give the identity of the perpetrator, okay, who killed this white girl for her uterus. And of course, you know, knowing the fake media, when they don't give the name or the identity, certainly the race of the perpetrator, you know they're either black or they're spicks, or there's white bags from Mexico, most likely black, but we will see. I have the article below, but it just gives you an idea of what we are dealing with, what we are dealing with. Savages, I mean, just when you think they have committed the worst possible crime that anybody could commit, here they come again and they will outdo themselves. I mean, this is the level of criminality of this subhuman population, just beyond any description. I mean, you know, I want to say animals, but even animals are, I mean, if you've ever seen animals in the forest, how they have compassion for their own, how the elephants go to the graveyards and literally weep over their dead relatives.

{"vid": "hate_video_165", "transcript": "Good evening and welcome to a new video. We're going to have a look at two Wakondons in a McDonald's having a epic chimp out and this is a chimp out to end all chimp outs. Epic chimp out time so let's see how these Wakondons act in this McDonald's in deepest darkest Chicago presumably. Nishanda Johnson has spent the last month reflecting on the worst day of her more than 10-year career with McDonald's. Early fucker Wakondon held a job down for 10 years. Must be some sort of record I say. Good share. It was here at the Colrain Township location near Ronald Reagan Highway where she was part of the now infamous over-the-counter food fight. Brittany Price says she waited for an incorrect food order to be fixed and eventually threw bags of food at Nishanda. How not to get a refund at McDonald's for your happy meal across the counter and a chocolate shake as well. That's one way not to get a refund you daft Wakondon. Brittany suffered a shattered cheekbone and broken nose when Nishanda chucked a blender at her and it ricocheted off. Dang! Bullseye! The Wakondons down I say. Her face. We see that again that was beautiful. Rulers decide. Nishanda chucked a blender at her and it ricocheted off her face. I say. Good shot. It was just very aggressive, very intensive. Of course you were chilled out. You were as calm as a Hindu cow. And almost demeaning. Even though we can see you chipping out on video. Ha ha! Liar! Nishanda remembers it differently. She the one who started this and never went down like... Ha ha! Look at that hair hat. Fuck me. There's no way that's your real hair love. What's that? 100% polyester? Fuck me. It looks ridiculous. Take that fucking thing off your head. That is she wouldn't ever do stuff like me. She says it was shift change and she was in the back with the general manager verifying money. Nishanda says she asked the general manager to handle the situation so she could finish. No, what happened was you said let this bitch wait. She's been giving me an attitude as a proud Wakanda and I'm going to give her an attitude and make her wait 20 minutes before she gets a refund until she loses her shit and throws a happy meal at me. And then I retaliate by throwing a blender in her face. That's what happened you liar. Come on, be honest. Nishanda stop doing what you're doing. Just go up there and give her the refund. So I'm like Karen, as soon as I get up there it's trying to blow up. You hear how she up there just going off cussing. Is that because you left there for 20 minutes because you were trying to be a bitch? She just wanted a refund. She's being real irate and real rude up there. Nishanda says she could hear cussing as she approached the counter and talked to me. Oh look at that. It's calm as a Hindu Carl. Look at that. She's just politely waiting but not chipping out at all even though it totally looks like she's chipping out. She also says only managers have the code to process refunds which added to Britney's more than 20 minutes before she gets a refund. Fuck you bitch. Wait 20 minutes for a refund. I have the power in this situation. Oh really? Fuck you. Take a happy meal. She's been going away from the register going to the back. She just started assaulting me from the back. She threw a chocolate milk and hit me in the head with it as I had my back turned so I turned around. Here come the apple juice, hit me in the face. All the happy meals in the brown paper bags. She just started going crazy. So her reaction had a reaction so while I'm getting assault. Yeah a reaction causes an opposite reaction. It doesn't mean that you throw a blender at a customer's face. Miss Nigeria 1992. Like it's just not on. That's why I would never hire a Rokon than if I had a McDonald's because I would be afraid that she might throw a fucking blender at my customer's face. No, you don't think that was a slight overreaction there? No. No you think that was reasonable do you? Oh dear. Thought I just picked up anything that was right there. Bang! Down she goes. Oh bullseye. Back at her. She's up. Oh no she's down. Do you regret throwing anything? Yeah I do because I miss my job. That's what I do. As Nishanda looks for a new job, Brittany sets more doctor's appointments. It's a pain. Bang! That's what a blender does. I never had no incident like this. Never. Because I always be able to diffuse the situation to whatever it is they food wrong. We cheat them out of money. Bang! Down she goes. Oh dear. Oh she's up. Oh she's down. Oh dear."}

They're just burning down cities and killing people. Not only black people, you idiot. It's called BLM. Why is it called BLM if it's not about black people? What? It's about how their lives matter. No, it's about privileging the black race so that they can be superior over whites. I don't get how that's... no. They demand that we pander to them. That we give them special rights, special privileges. That we change the whole legal system so that black people don't go to jail. So it's all about. I disagree. What do you mean you disagree? How? They're saying they want to abolish the police, abolish basically jails. Essentially they just want to get away with crimes, right? It's like, we're going to just be gang bangers and pimps and if you put us in prison, you're a racist. Yep, so that's all they are. They're just gang bangers and pimps to you. They want black criminals to get off, yes. Okay. You can believe that, but... So why would you support that as a white woman? Do you think these black men are going to treat you well or something? I don't think every criminal is a black man, no. But specifically if we allow black criminals to get out of prison, you think that's going to be better for society? I think you're really fucking dramatic and it's funny. Really dramatic? That's what they want. That's what they say that they want. Okay. Did you talk to them? Well they say abolish the police, do they not? Did you talk to all of them? Like all black people in the whole world? Well I see what the BLM movement represents and it represents black supremacy. It represents black power and... No, I'm having equal rights. No, that's a fake ruse that they put on to convince dupes like you to go along with it, yes. Oh, okay, yeah, I'm a dup. You're a dup, you're a useful idiot for black power. Oh, right, okay. What use are you? How does it feel to be a useful idiot for black supremacy? Okay. I literally don't give a shit. You don't care, you don't care because all you care about is getting the virtue signaling brownie points, right? Oh yeah, definitely. Look at me, I'm such a great person. I love black people. At least I don't hate black people and think that all of them are criminals. Well not all of them are criminals, just a disproportionate amount of them are. No, you literally were just saying how they're all criminals. Like are you okay? Well I said that the BLM movement are savages as they are. They're burning down cities. See what they did in Kenosha? And it was strictly only black people, right? Well what you have is black people and then... Well it's strictly only black people, right? Well you have black people and then white liberal savages who are also with them. Alright, alright, I'm on the black savage, let's go. Yeah, you guys support terrorism, you guys support burning, looting and killing. Right, yeah, I forgot. For black power. And you support a lot of bullshit, what I seem to hear. Well the white people who support BLM hate themselves, they hate their race and they want to see white people suffer. I want none of that so I just want to... They've been indoctrinated by communists in universities to think of white people as evil oppressors and that we have to pay the price for what some ancestors did 200 years ago. Are you okay?

It's the return of the Grand Wizard of the KKK. He didn't just say what I think he did did he? And SJWs said nothing. Ykikes SJWs are dead there locked in my basement. Feminist women love Moonman. Jigga jigga jigga. Moonman, I love him. Look at him walking around grabbing his giant Mooncock, flipping the niggers and Jews. Yeah, but he's so cute though. He's deep. Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose, but no worse than what's going on in Ferguson, Missouri. Sometimes I wanna start shooting black spics and Jews, but it's cool for niggers to shoot our police officers. My cock is on your lips, my cock is on your lips. And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss and that's the message that we deliver to little nigs and expect them to know what freedom and education is. Of course they gonna know what my dick is. By the time they hit fourth grade, they are on the Discovery Channel. Aren't they? Niggers are nothing but animals. Well, some of them are cannibals who cut other people open like antelopes. But if they can hump dead animals and antelopes, then there's no reason why a nigger shouldn't be at the end of a rope. But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote. Cheapoons, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes. Cause I'm the Moonman. Yes, the real Moonman. All you other Moonman are just imitating.

So you guys could just lie to get me here? Maybe sit me here next to Audrey in a patridge? Yo shit, Anders Bravik better switch me chairs. So I can sit next to Dylan Ruehn-Bengarrison. And here M.R.U over who killed niggers and Jews. First, little kikes, I dare you to put me on MTV. Yeah, he's cute, but I think he wants to gas Jews. TV. I should send you to my camp for free and show the whole world how you gave Moonman BD. I'm sick of you little kike and nigger kids. All you do is annoy me. So I have been sent here to destroy you. And there's a million of us just like me. Who cuss like me? Who just don't give a fuck like me. Who dress like me? Who shouldogo peu Play on Who once really liked D.J? Scamming the title. The only difference is I got the balls to shoot niggers in front of you all and I don't gotta be false or sugar coated at all. I just grab my gun and start shooting, and whether you like to admit it, I just shit on Jews. Better than 90% of you fake clansmen out can. Then you wonder how can fact seed up these albums like Valium's. It's funny cause of the rate in going when Im 30. I'll be the only person in the lesbian clinic hurting, pinching feminist asses when Im jacking off with moon ladies and Im jerking. But this whole thing of Viagra isn't working, and every single person is a moonman working. He could be working at McDonald's spitting on all of you nicks or in the parking lot circling, screaming gas the kites. He's worn out, with his windows down in the system. So will the real moonman please stand up, and see Kyle raising your right arm straight up, and be proud to be out of your mind and out of control. And one more time, loud as you can, oh does it go. Cause Im the Moonman, yes the real moonman. All you other moonmen are just imitating. So won't the real moonman please stand up, please stand up. Please stand up, cause Im the moonman.

Christos isn't a surname, it's a title, the Greek word for the man who the ancient Hebrews foresaw it in the future be their messiah and it came to be. Adolf H. Christ came along in Bukhavita so righteous he disenfranchised the Jew and then put the lights out he let us see that the Hebrew was a creature and not a person. He shut down with no reason, the treaty of Versailles was a motivator he used to raise the war cry, he riled his people up to start a second world war. One in which more dosh had he never got a chance to see my rise to success which he invited rather than let the reds defile them he and his aves suicided, despite it, I show him the utmost respect when I drop rhymes.

The white unemployment rate is nearly more than triple for black. That's why I put a gun in their back. Eliminate crack. Cut down on robbery, combat poverty and stimulate the national economy. Niggers don't make the world a better place. I'm doing my part to save the white race. Even when we throw them in prison, still live in still costing us money. This is true. I keep spitting.

{"vid": "hate_video_215", "transcript": "On my way to the clan rally to celebrate my highest kill tally, a grand finale to this day before I load up on ammo and go on a killing spree tomorrow. But while driving my Tahoe my GPS miscalculated directions, created a path through the wrong neighborhood I glanced over and there they stood, a group of emaciated men addicted to wood. That's right, I was staring straight at a pack of bags. This was sending red flags, somehow I drove into Queer Street, grabbed my block in the heartbeat, the clan rally had to wait, my priority was to kill this group of 8 ass bandits who were under way, probably from the chivey infecting their bodies and mine. So I walked behind one of the cock jockeys and blew out his brains. A drenlin rushing through my veins trampled over the deadfacts, remains and fired into the backs of the shitstappers calling ass from the scene, but their ass was grass, if you know what I mean. Truth lies dropping like craze, mowing down daisies. My vision was hazy cause I was a little blitzed, smoked some good shit beforehand. But I still managed to blow away the gaze, ripping the triple keg. My lunar abilities on display. Managed to find the rally before it ended. And despite not arriving at the time intended it was splendid, but driving onto Queer Street wasn't so bad, executing Homo's is rough. The time I'll get here a tad bit earlier so I don't miss much of the rally I should travel to South Cali for my summer vacation. I hear it's the game as part of the nation, more Queer Streets for me to wipe out. I just hope my GPS knows the route. San Bernardino will look like child's play after the moon rises."}

The last nigger I seen that got away. Perhaps the following day he was hung by the triple K. Relax. I'm not gonna slack on blacks now. All I'm trying to say is that's your last line of crap. Cause I ain't playing around. It's a game called drop to the ground. And the police know how to drop filthy niggers down. But I'm still trying to wipe all the blacks out. Thought I had it mapped out.

I'm not afraid to take a stand against niggers. So everybody, except for niggers, come take my hand. Come take my hand. We'll end this race together. Killing nonwhites cause white is better when we unite. Just letting you know that you're not alone. So let me know if you think you could break a nigger's jawbone. And I just can't keep living this way. So starting today. I'm killing 12 niggers a day. I'm standing up. I'm a face those niggers. I'm moon manning up. I'm a shoot them down. I've had enough. Now I'm so fed up. Time to put this country back together right now. It was my decision to get an M16. I did it for me. Admittedly, I probably caused many crime scenes for you. So white power can come back and see a new moon. You don't even realize how much I love killing coons. I've been shooting niggers. Giving leftists and liberals the middle finger. I think I got a tear in my eye from macing that nigger. In my world, niggers can make like left wingers and drop dead. No more niggers means no more drama from now on. So I promise to focus solely on crushing the population of these incompatible black cunts. So I solemnly swear to always treat niggers like my washed socks and hang them. But they weren't so fucking ugly I would hang them. Cause the way I feel I'm strong enough to go to the club with my coffee mug and beat all the spear chuckers up. Cause I'm raising the bar. I would shoot for the moon but I'm too busy using the bar to beat the fuck out of coons. I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid to take a stand against niggers. So everybody, except for niggers, come take my hand. Come take my hand. We'll end this race together. Killing non-whites cause white is better when we unite. Just letting you know that you're not alone. So let me know if you think you can break a nigger's jawbone. Thank you for watching."}

We got men like Patrick here to protect all that is white, no matter what kind of invaders they may be. We know that to them we will have to see. Niggers, shinks, hedges, kikes, and specks. Let's also remove dumb ass faggots who like to suck tics. We will take out those destroying us from the inside. They will simply have nowhere to hide.

White terror is the gift that keeps on giving. We must secure the existence of our people, and a future for white children. Nice job summing things up in the manifesto. Also not a bad high score at all. Well done bro, these god damn shitskin invaders will replace our race. But not of course if we stick a rifle in their face. Go straight back to Smelly Dockoland, or I strike you with my hand. Their invasion will not really go as planned. A word of English they do not understand. We should hire guys like Patrick to patrol the border. No Spick would want to leave their shithole mortar. Or is it Mexico? They are both full of orcs, probably eat with hands instead of knives and forks. The kikes in power are gone as start a civil war, once we win Mexico will be no more. A next match should for ourselves. What's next? The soldiers of the triple K will not be vexed. Patrick on that day took out many a beehner. People on that day lost many a cleaner. He gathered them up and chucked them in a steamer. The Spick population's looking a bit cleaner. They belong in camps of femur, not us, where they should really be as under a bus. I wish there were concentration camps at the border. I honestly don't understand any of the fuss. Because the beauty of the white-arian woman must not perish from the earth.

You porch monkeys used to be such a benefit. I longed for the time plantations were relevant, where I'd crack a whip you would work, and not bitch, you'd pick my cotton and make me filthy fucking wrench. You had to use back then, no need for a new back then. I could get you to work and produce back then with. Just pee in my whip, just pee in my whip. Just he and my plantation I would have would be the biggest. The nigs on my cotton farm would work the quickest. They'd contribute to making this moon the richest slave owner in the south. And I'd have the thickest dick too, and I could write my sick ass rhymes in peace. Then at night I'd kick that and count my dimes in peace. The only time one of my miggers would see his who work is if they died or were caught by the police, my house would be the whitest like my skin's the lightest. I'd make sure they never got a chance and the slightest to ever obtain rights or escape to the north, their use as my nigs slave would be their only word.

Every time I hear one say that I need a big hit then I need to grab my whip and lash at a nick. Use a whip crack to make the nick do a jig. It helped me relax and relive the glory days when that the nigger misbehaved, they were set ablaze and no one gave a shit, cause niggers weren't human. Then the 14th amendment had to go and ruin it and pave the way for a party to be destroyed and leave a void where the segregation I enjoyed used to be, now it's all about equality.

I swore off to another world deep in my mind but niggers seem to take that as being unkind. Oh your bat moon is racist. Really on a recall, I'm a man of the whites, not a fan of black people. Believe that if you wanna, but I tell you this, much. Niggers and spicks and Jews suck. Once again a case of me shooting off your black knees. When I see a room full of nasty looking niggers I say, gun please, you black's armed living. I just pulled the plug, I just ended the life of you chimps and you yugs.

It was one nigg-mug after one nigg-mug. I don't always cook but when I do I cook the whole hog. And I have the formula to save the world. It's simple just eliminate the nigger monkeys, yes boys and girls. I'm the type of cracker with the crazy deadly fight plan. Dissin' all the niggers while I'm honoring the white man supposed to be in prison. But I got back with my people. I go out with a triple K and separate the eagles.

I'll take your Yamagostek and monopork Bob Dipidin wine, and send him off to a synagogue. And just as spite you more, I'll say it again, the Fjr has returned, and his name is Moonman.

I'm a knicker's are getting cut up with a machete I'd love to hack them all apart. They're on a triple K contract. Once again the Jews suck them all how I feel. I chopped them apart too and got a half mil before I had a record deal. Therefore you look and stare like it's magic but too much of anything can make you addict. Whenever niggers be starting static, break out the automatic. I set it off straight, I spread hate and I vacate. But wait, who dares to cross this path? I'll do like math. Cut you with glass, make a blood bath. So on behalf of all crackers I get drunk with smoking blood sweat. Dispose of your nigger shit and keep it all in perspective.

You mow the fucking mobs down with the best gun at your disposal. If that's not your style, then my proposal is for you to fly to LA and jump in traffic on the fifth mistake to cause your faggot the correct answer for anti-fascists and niggers. This is a grab-to-machine gun and hold-bow triggers. And watch as the stupid ass mob goes cook then for added measure, do a room and salute and air for the faggot still living to fight you. Something like this is what Aryans might do. But if you're a 17-year-old like Hispanic in a group shielding Kenosha from the Manics with NAR-15 in your hands, hearing a constant stream of nigger faggot demands what you might do is spend the night being a cut-prety to give first aid, or even giving a fuck about what stupid rioters have to say, not knowing you're the one who's gonna blast away a peto-ball, a white peeper, and wannabe Gabara, and be all over the juice news on the morrow reading of kike bandits who wanna see a minor whipped in prison liners who are gonna die of AIDS because you had the audacity to defend yourself from shitty people who wanted you dead and felt like killing a Hispanic was the right way to obtain justice for dumb nigger cause they are gay. Then you might find yourself running across town from a bald peto-ball who chose to chase you down.

I've been busy doing my duty to the white race by mowing down the browns, catapulting spicks over the wall, and hanging niggers from trees. Since the death of George Floyd, the Nignogs have been losing their shit, and like 1992, they have decided that the best way to teach us white people a lesson is for them to burn down their own neighborhoods, businesses, and homes in the name of racial justice. You are probably thinking. Moonman, why make a video about the Nignogs destroying their mud huts? That does not hurt the white race at all. The problem is that white soyboy faggot communists have decided that this will be the perfect time to begin the Red Revolution on America's streets. The fucking Democrats have shown their true colors and come out in defense of the Nignogs and pinkos. District attorneys are automatically releasing rioters that have been arrested for horrific acts of violence, the police are being defunded or stood down by leftist mayors, or just outright being disbanded by these communist traitors. They believe that the average American is as brain dead as their puppet, Joe I got Harry Legs Biden, and will swallow their blatant lies as much as their soyboy cuckolds love choking on black dick every day. Well don't worry fellow freedom lovers. Moonman is back, and I'm going to be sending these commies crying back to their mummies. Vote Trump 2020, and have a blessed white day."}

{"vid": "hate_video_269", "transcript": "King Kuhn. We will raise the Negro to prominence in sports and entertainment to make them appear as suitable mates for the white woman. This is a paraphrase of Israel Kohan's racial program of the 20th century published in the early 1900s which sets out a plan for the mongrelization of the white race through the intermix of kinds, through the glorification of the Negro as a celebrity figure. Thus the lowly savage of darkest Africa is transposed into a King Kuhn figure and the gullible white population, especially the women, given their emotional mind, are conscripted into this mongrelization protocol, volunteering their daughters and selves as sacrificial gifts on the altar of egalitarian secular humanism, which has become established through the propaganda ministry as a new religion, any questioning of which becomes sin and sacrilege, the heresy of post-modernity. Progress, it is called, this downward spiral trend of the subtle and gradual genocide and displacement of one's own kind with sub-IQ savages. The King Kuhn, draped in golden jewels as a modern voodoo priest, a King Solomon as put forth as a hero figure, a hyper-masculine uber-mench who constitutes the embodiment of virility, thereby increasing the probability of his appeal to the naive and brainwashed white masses, the males wanting to emulate this figure, the females to fornicate with him, such as the intention of the Jewish mind manipulator who uses his system of illusion to create the reality of the desirability of what was only just a few decades ago looked upon as a lowly creature, only slightly elevated from the brute and in fact debated as to whether he was not either the missing lake or an amalgam of beast and man, which ladders probably the reality from a bio-anthropological standpoint. Portraying such a creature as the height of masculinity devolves masculinity and humanity to the level of a beast, which is the intention of the Jew to create their mongrelized and debased product of mixture, which would, so they believe in their utopian fantasizing, control the entire world for themselves and enslave all others in their tyranny. The transposition of values herein consists of the negro, former brute, being elevated over the status of a white male, former inventor and creator and the latter being demoted to the level of a wiggerized slave, useful only as a tool to be dispensed with, once used up in its productive capacity, drained of its life force as a human battery to be done away with economically, replacement in occupation with non-whites and physically through the allopathic genocide system, thus the white female, though instinctively gravitating toward their own kind as per natural inclinations, perversely shuns her own people through their having been stripped of their status as a valuable commodity and her economic worldview, libidinal economy and social economics, the prudential calculus of decision making on the basis of resource acquisition and provision, i.e. exploitation of men as a resource provider and status object. Given that the new normal socially engineered by the Jew is that the non-white is giving everything under the Jew, of course, first among equals, the white male is looked upon as of subordinate status and thus is cut out of the mating gain thereby reducing the white birth rate and enabling the Jew to gain greater power and advantage as he hides behind his non-white fronts in the seats of power and claims the status of a humanitarian, a philanthropist who simply wants to give the non-whites a chance, a chance to rape and a chance to create mongrel offspring and to ruin the women of the white race whose naivety leads them to fall the way of all flesh. Whatever the Jew and his media portrays as socially acceptable, creating a new reality out of the old, reifying his ideals, the women being collectivists and replicating slash parroting whatever the party line or mores of society happens to be at one moment or another, follow the crowd off the clip and so long as they are not singled out as an outsider, eagerly go to their own destruction through the destruction of their family line. The white male has now been debased to the level of a brute, a worker or a vagrant, an outcast who has no entitlement to representation in his own ancestral territory. Of course, this will be construed as complaining to speak of the realities of life but is an adequate representation of fact, no mere opinion. And so far as the regime exists, this program of mongrelization will exist and the process through which it is effected the means to its realization will also exist. The solution is simply to detach oneself from the controlled system propaganda and to make a counter strike of anti-system propaganda of Rasen hygiene or racial purity in place of Rasen and Tartang or racial degeneration to counter the Jews' moves in the game of chess between darkness and light and this through the propounding a traditionalist ethics and ideology which resurrects Allah al-Aziris, the stability of a decayed culture and racial group who only a few if not only a single decade ago was a much healthier world with people who actually had a consciousness which rejected the rot of Rasen and Tartang and understood its corrupting influence. However, what led us to stray the demographic was a relentless demoralization protocol of the Jew which was used as a mechanism of eroding the healthy instincts of the white population. At this point, there still exists the establishment of the mongrel as hero or anti-hero being endowed with a supreme right to pontificate as immoral superior and to imply the immorality of the white population. However, the scales on the eyes of the broad masses are falling away and they no longer exalt to such an extent as they previously did the cannibal savage of darkest Africa as their primitive superman. No longer do the paintings of Gauguin of brown tropical females or the bleatings and jarring cacophony of jazz music and rap appeal to the sensibilities of the broad masses. For they are listening to the call of the blood memory which awakens in their consciousness and understanding of their traditions and identity enabling them to break free of the mold of the Zog matrix and its anti-white protocols."}

If I was only a nigger, I could afford to live in a white neighborhood. Oh, the things that I could do, if I was black and hell bent, I could send my kids to college, and it wouldn't cost me one damn cent. Damn, I wish I was a nigger. The wife and I were down on our luck. We were really getting uptight. They said at the welfare office, you ain't black, you're white. Oh, how I've tried to get a job, a diploma I have with pride. The post office man laughed and said, you're not dark enough to even qualify. Damn, I wish I was a nigger. I took a civil service exam and passed it without shame. A nigger took one next to me, and he couldn't even write his own name. The nigger, he got the job. Now he's got him a top brass. He couldn't qualify for a trash truck. I'm out on the street, oh my ass. Damn, I wish I was a nigger. If I was a Jesse Jackson, I'd be nobody's slob, wearing $500 suits. That nigger hasn't even got a job.

If I was a U-Bangie, seven foot tall and lean, I could be a famous player on a Washington basketball team. If I was only chocolate brown, I could have me some turnip greens, a possum fad and watermelon, chetlins, and a pot of butter beans. Damn, I wish I was a nigger. Now a Martin Luther King was buried in Washington with class, face down in his box so the politicians could kiss his ass. I guess it's just politics, and it sure gets my goat. Kiss assing with a nigger just to get his vote. Damn, I wish I was a nigger. If I was only a burrhead, I'd live high on a hill, selling cocaine and prostitutes, and popping all kinds of pills. Now take the NAACP, they can march and raise all kinds of hell, let the KKK start to move, and they'll all wind up in jail. Damn, I wish I was a nigger. I dreamed my life was over. I heard St. Peter say, today we're taking only niggers, you've got to go the other way. Then I heard the devil. He said I heard what Peter had to say, but I'm sorry to tell you, son, today in hell is nigger day. Damn, don't you wish you were a nigger? I'm going back to the hills of Arkansas where they don't have those knocked down one-sided nigger peace marches, protesters, welfare check-rabbers.

At some point, the back of her head slammed against the handle of a bench lathe, where her blood and hair would later be found. He raped her. He strangled her to death with a cord. Then on his orders, his Negro employee dragged her face down over the floor to the basement incinerator, but got cold feet about burning the body, and so he left her there. Here's a picture of the 13-year-old Mary Fagan with her aunt. She was somebody's daughter. They expected to watch her grow to womanhood, to someday fall in love and get married, to have children of her own and raise them, and know what it's like to be a mother. But none of that happened, because this is what happened to her. And it was done by this repulsive-looking Neanderthal hybrid, this typically perverted kike, Leo Frank. Where real humans, that is to say whites, would denounce and shun one of their own who committed such an act, even if against a non-white, not the Jews, oh no. The Jews must cover up the crimes of their tribe, especially when it is a crime typical to their very different nature from ours, a crime that draws attention to their differences from us. Lest we finally rise against them as a group and sweep them from the face of the earth, as needs to be done."}

{"vid": "hate_video_324", "transcript": "New York City formed an Asian hate crime task force after spiking anti-Asian attacks. Okay now I'll tell you exactly what's going to happen to this task force. They're going to expand it after like about 10 days. Why 10 days? I tell you. Because they're going to find that all of the attackers, as has been the case for the past six months or for that matter, 75 years, all the racially motivated attack are caused by blacks and some Hispanic, but they're mostly blacks. Let me give you an example of the task force during the Dinkins administration after the Howard Beach fiasco, you know, where they were alleging that this white kids attacked as blacks. The mayor Dinkins, the worst president, the worst president, the worst mayor ever by New York City or any country on the face of the earth, he established this task force to catch the racist. They wanted to catch the racist. So what they did, they had this task for, what they did was they had a black cop in civilian clothing walk through a white neighborhood, you know, with like a backup in the background, so that every time he will be attacked by the white racist, he will call the backup and arrest those evil white racists. Now in the spirit of political correctness, he had a white cop do the same thing. White cop or cops walk through black neighborhoods in civilian clothing and then if he was attacked by blacks, right, he will call backup. Well, they had to stop that after, now this was supposed to go on for, you know, for months or years, but they had to stop it after only 10 days. And you know why? Do you realize why? I tell you why, because the white cop was literally, literally as reported by the Daily News and the New York Post, was lit, not the New York Times by the way, the white cop was literally attacked every 20 minutes by blacks. He was literally attacked and some of the white cops had to be hospitalized for trauma, for psychological trauma. Okay, now you're probably saying, well, the black cop must have been attacked every like two seconds. Well, in those 10 days, the black cop was attacked exactly zero, zero times. There were no incidents of white racism. There were only incidents of black racism, as you would expect, because blacks are the most violent, most racist, the biggest haters on the planet. So this thing, you know, it's not going to go far. Or maybe times have changed and they throw a couple of thousand blacks in prison because they attack Asian and they attack everybody. They really should have a task force on blacks attacking everybody. And I guarantee you, they're going to fill the prison to the roof."}

When she stood there and witnessed her husband, Terry Hughes, standing there and being bundled by Hollywood mogul as suspected by sexual family man Adam Vinnett. But neither the deep freeze frigid temperatures nor the darkness of the devils which in our could stop our protagonist, Jesse, the reluctant hero and self-proclaimed super bitch in his quest to bring super gay to the world. But first, I need to show my boss, Lily Daniels, that I'm famous enough to bring the gay superhero movie that he has in development to the big screen. Love you, Lily! So Jesse, wonder what if I put my plan into motion, but first I'll need some people. But wait, I just got some friends that got here from Africa! So let me call those sexy Nigerians and get this thing moving. Subway! Here I go! Oh boy, I thought everybody forgot we were accused of being a haven for pedophiles. Damn you, Coon Watch!

I can't deny it, I got excited when the Africans grabbed me, they were swollen over six feet. Oh my gosh, did you hear that? Go! After worldwide acceptance of his fantasy story, Jesse couldn't stop there, he went further. And above all, I fought the fuck back. I fought back by grabbing a sheep, fought back by grabbing a sheep. Jesse got the big head and he went even further. I'm the Gay Tupac. I'm the Gay Tupac. But now, Jesse stepped the fuck off. Gay actor attacked by two men wearing magnums, I don't think so. Let's see if he's who we think he is. It's him alright. Oh my god. All of Jesse's LGBT friends have turned their backs on him. They're so disappointed like Gay Tyler Perry and Gay Him.

And we'll pay you. And so I mean, this is what he's doing. This is what he's buying into. He's probably trying to make an honest living, maybe even trying to get a beer or something. Like you never know in this day and age. And so I'm going to tell you now, family, tune in tonight into my live stream on my YouTube channel, Deep Program and Light in there. And also on Zoom, I'm going to actually really put out some powerful information. And this guy, man, they got this guy had dancing and it's extremely cold. It's like 20 degrees and this guy out here dancing and performing perfunery. But what else is he going to do? What else are you going to do? You got to get your minds right, King. You got to get your minds right, Queens. You're better than this. You are better than this. You're better. And so, you know, this is what they're turning you into. They're turning you into tricks. Tricks. Drone man out in a Statue of Liberty uniform, cruel stressing. For a few peanuts. Dance monkey dance. Dance monkey dance. For a few peanuts. Got him waving and dancing and carrying on. Just I mean, it's really insulting. And so you got to think how much self esteem. Once you have a left and this man looks like he could easily, you know, be like maybe towards his late 50s, early 60s. How much self esteem must this guy have to just go out on a curb and do this? Put on a damn clown suit, cross stressing. And you know, in a bitter cold and just, you know, dance like he's some little monkey. I mean, because that's what's going on. See, I see between I see beyond the smile in the distance and I see reality. So you've been under the sounds of the voice of Todd the Doc. I just had to put this up here and let you guys see this. This is like, it's just ridiculous, man. It's ridiculous. Look at this guy. This is a grown man doing this. This is not a teen. This is a grown man doing this, either in his 50s, maybe early 60s, carrying on just to get peanuts. Just to get peanuts. Think about it. And all of you out here, all you other ones out here just doing this, you are actually an insult to your race. Todd the Doc is out. Look at this guy. Look at this guy. Traffic move. Even look at this guy. This is an embarrassment, man. This is an embarrassment. I'm going to say she'll learn, family."}

{"vid": "hate_video_353", "transcript": "Okay, this is the kind of crime that you're not going to hear about on the six o'clock news, news or the national news or the front page of any newspaper. There's a black male by the name of Javon Hatchet who went on to stab nearly to death. The guy's lucky to be alive. An auto zone worker because the black felt the need to find a white male to kill. Now he's accused of beating his white cellmate to death over the weekend. So they put him, this racist black, they put him in the same jail with a white cellmate and then he goes on of course to beat because his racism doesn't stop once he's in prison. So the lawyers are saying, why did you put this racist black male in the same prison as with another white male? You're not going to put a rapist according to the lawyer. You're not going to put a rapist in the same prison cell with a woman. This is the kind of news that's happening more and more, blacks committing racial crime. This one that made the list here is really quite red because they normally don't talk about it. It's time for white people and black people to live separate lives really. There should be segregation. Whites should not be allowed anywhere near blacks and the other way around. Blacks especially should not be allowed near white people. They should not go to white businesses because you know there's going to be violence. Every time you see this violent outburst in restaurants, McDonald's, liquor stores, bodegas, it's always black males attacking whites, attacking the owners, attacking the clerks. I cannot believe that this country, the white people in this country are actually tolerating this. The media obviously has a lot to do with it because they don't like to report on this. But this is what's happening. This guy goes on to kill white people because they're white male. Because why? Because he saw some video of cops restraining black criminals. He just goes to show you that we cannot live with blacks. It's just impossible. And the media is not making it easier by basically squashing the news, not reporting on it, ignoring it, finding excuses for it. They find excuse for this black criminals all the time. This has got to stop. This has got to stop."}

Hooknosed wrapped. We never let old Shackleston play any KKK games. Like Hang the Nigger.

Then Moonman pulled out his block and shot him. As the town folk shouted out with glee, they never had to look at Shackleston's hooknose for the rest of the eternity. Moonman Moonman you're so heroic I love you, you shot that kike dead tonight. Won't you shove that massive mooncock all up in my guts tonight?

{"vid": "hate_video_371", "transcript": "My concern is doing away with whiteness. Whiteness is a form of racial oppression. Sure. The suggestion is that it is somehow possible to separate whiteness from oppression, and it is not. There can be no white race without the phenomenon of white supremacy. If you abolish slavery, you abolish slaveholders. In the same way, if you abolish racial oppression, you do away with whiteness. Treason to whiteness is loyalty to humanity. Your views are fairly well received in academia. Yes, they legitimate. Not to say that everyone agrees, but sure. I could not point to any examples where it has provoked political censorship. Whiteness is an identity that arises entirely out of oppression. Whiteness is not a culture, it's not a religion, it's not a language, it's simply an oppressive social category. Blackness is an identity that can be plausibly argued. Black studies is a study of a people that has formed itself in resistance to its oppression. The task is to bring this minority together in such a way that it makes it impossible for the legacy of whiteness to continue to reproduce itself. At this point in time, Europe has not yet learned how to be multicultural. And I think we're going to be part of the throes of that transformation, which must take place. Europe is not going to be the monolithic societies that they once were in the last century. Jews are going to be at the center of that. It's a huge transformation for Europe to make. They are now going into a multicultural mode, and Jews will be resented because of our leading role. But without that leading role and without that transformation, Europe will not survive."}

About what's going on in the Middle East and then I started reading some news articles and I was just like, oh I couldn't sleep. So then it dawned on me. You know, Tel Aviv is the gay capital of the world. And we're over there in the Middle East fighting wars for Jews and it dawned on me. Well no wonder we're over there fighting wars for Jews. They're a bunch of fucking faggots. They're too busy sucking each other's dicks and having gay butt sex in order to go fight their own wars. They're a bunch of fucking pussies. Everyone knows we're over there fighting for Jews. All you have to do is look at the news. You see, BV and Trump like basically giving each other hand jobs on stage. You know, BV, I read this article last night saying, oh we need to take a backseat approach and let Donald Trump deal with this. This is his problem. We didn't cause this issue. Give me a break. We all know they're the ones funding ISIS. We know that they're, we're there. Just there to serve Israel, the Greater Israel Project. Now isn't this interesting? I talk about this stuff on YouTube and I get kicked off. I've been getting kicked off for making relatively calm videos being anti-war. I'm much more amped up at this point because I'm pissed. You know, and I shared this like, I don't know, 25 second clip of Hillary Clinton talking on mainstream media saying if she was elected president she'd go to war with Iran first thing. And my comment, you know, on the title was basically like, oh I voted for Donald Trump, not Hillary Clinton. They removed the video and gave me a friggin' strike. I didn't even say anything myself. All it was was the 25 second video of Hillary Clinton. I'm gonna put it on Bitshoot now. I'm gonna put it on Telegram. I'm gonna put it on Facebook, whatever. This is ridiculous. So if you want to be a good American, you want to be a patriot, I'll tell you what to do. Go sign up for the military and go over to the Middle East and get yourself blown up for some fuckin' Jews. That's what you gotta do. Go tell your sons and daughters to go over to the Middle East and get blown up for fuckin' Jews so they can suck each other's dicks and have gay butt sex with each other. That's it. That's all there is to it. And speaking of this, I mean just look at the amount of a supremacy that Israel is causing. They've got a wall around their entire country. They don't let in anybody. You have to be Jewish in order to get in. If I want those same things as a white man, I'm called a white supremacist and a neo-Nazi. What a bunch of bullshit. So again, just go over and fight for Jews. They can go suck each other's dicks and have butt sex and share AIDS with one another. And we'll go over there and fight and die for the fuckin' Jews.

Imagine if a white man was to make a movie about the very real ritual genital mutilation of the Jewish community or to take some creative liberties in portraying Jewish ritual murder. There would be endless coveging, bannings, possibly some untimely deaths, and media loudly proclaiming that such hatred is actually incitement to violence. However, when you have a Jew like Ari Aster, who directed her editory, now releasing a film to paint Europeans who embrace their pre-Judeo-Christian ways in the worst possible light, it is just incredible artistic expression. Ari Aster is a Jew who obviously hates white people and our culture. Wholesome things like flower crowns, runes, white people dressed in white, and celebrating the turning of the seasons are seen as being insanely evil. Honestly, this Jew is just doing what Judeo-Christians have done for centuries, now with a new medium with which to terrify people into embracing the Torah. Just take a look at the trailer for this film and you will see what I am talking about. Christian says that you've got some special thing planned. Yeah, it's like a crazy nine day festival. It only happens every 90 years. Hi. Hello. Hey, Robert. You can't speak? Hey, Pete. You can't speak? You can't move? But this opens you up to the influence and it breaks down your defenses. Trust me.

Well, there's no good reason for the US to be in Syria if you are only considering American interests, and that's only a tiny fraction of what is important these days. What matters most to Trump, Republicans and Democrats is protecting Israel at all costs, whatever it takes. It could not be more straightforward at this point. Trump is a puppet of Israeli interests doing whatever shelled an Adelson and B's liquidnics tell him to do. John Bolton and Jared Kushner are right there by Trump's side to ensure there is not even a slight derivation from the plan. Our country is being run by Jews, who are using American soldiers and weaponry as pawns to achieve their foreign policy objectives. We must face this obvious reality.

{"vid": "hate_video_409", "transcript": "And they continue to fucking do this shit from YouTube. I say, well, fuck you. I'm gonna retaliate against you. I'll escalate this fucking conflict until you don't want to fuck with me anymore. And yeah, I contacted Alt. I said, you want to go fucking fuck some assholes over? And rather than take the information from me, he published my email to Twitter. And then immediately after that, Angry White Man published something that was the result of a month's long in fucking investigation. And they lost some shit. And I'm fucking glad because they suck and they don't deserve a platform. Now, let me ask you a couple of things. Now, first off, Holt, you didn't preface your email with, you know, look, it's Jared Holt. I'm not going to say he necessarily would have respected that anyway. But excuse me, by the way, you didn't say, you know, can we talk off the record or this and that? So I guess by the official journalistic code, he's can actually share that, you know what I mean? Did you think about doing that or? I don't give a fuck. Like, the thing is that if I had given him the information, I'd have told everybody that I gave him the information. This is not something that I was trying to do surreptitiously, right? So like every time that I've talked to the federal government, every time I've talked to the media, I tell everybody exactly what I've done, right? So like, you know, my whole fucking, the reason that people have all this fucking, you know, people take things out of fucking context, but like the reason people have so much out of context shit to say about me is because I feel obligated to like inform people of what I'm doing when I engage in these things. Okay. And so I didn't, you know, I hadn't given Holt any information. So I didn't feel like I needed to say anything yet. But like if I had done this, I'd have taken credit for it. I'd be like, yeah, I got you deep platform. Do not fuck with me asshole. That's exactly what I would have said. So like I didn't really care. It was suboptimal that he published it the way he did. You know, I would have preferred things to go differently, but you know, it's not like I think that the fucking left wing media is going to adhere to a fucking standard of decency anywhere. There are a bunch of lying Jopricks. Now, let me ask you, can you see why some people might see this and like be upset with what you did here? I would expect them to be upset. I'm trying to fuck them over. That's the whole entire point. No, but I mean, just other people as well. Like, I mean, I, you're, it's kind of funny the way you put it after. I'll read it again. I've got some interesting conflicts, which would best best be solved by my competitors getting the platform that, that, uh, I laugh when I read it because it's just flat out take them off the air. That's exactly what I'm trying to do. Right. So like they use, look, these guys are on YouTube. They're violating the terms of service. Right. And so like they, and like they had me on, they had me on goi talk to go and respond to these defamations that they were giving fucking voice to, right? But the thing is that since they're violating the terms of service, what they do is they delete the streams afterwards. So there's not an archive. They take their super chats and they take the fucking money and run. Right. So they have me on to respond to the defamations, but then the next day they're out there airing the defamations again. Well, I'm not going to go on your fucking channel every day and respond to this every time, obviously. Right. So like something has to be done in order to stop these fucking assholes from defaming my character. Okay. That's a leak. If in the ethno state, fucking character defamation is legally actionable. Okay. And so the fucking, so since I can't punch these fucking faggots in their faces, I find other ways to fucking make their lives difficult. And if I can fucking feed them to the Jews, then I will."}

A real people derives as genius from the land, from the sun, from the sea, from the soil, you know, this is how they know themselves. But like Jews don't even have soil. He has Israel? Yeah. Those aren't Jews. Of course they're Jews. Notice the Israelis. It's a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil, because the real Jew is a wanderer. He's a nomad. He's got no roots and no attachments, so he universalizes everything. He can't hammer a nail or plow a field. All he can do is buy and sell and invest capital and manipulate markets, and you know, it's like all mental. He takes a life of a people that's rooted in soil, and then he turns it into this cosmopolitan culture, based on books and numbers and ideas, and, you know, this is his strength. You can take the greatest Jewish minds ever. Marx, Freud, Einstein, what have they given us? Communism, infantile sexuality, and the atom bomb. In the mere three centuries, it's taken these people to emerge from the ghettos of Europe. They've ripped us out of a world of order and reason. They've thrown us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges, relativity. Into a world where now the very existence of matter and meaning is in question. Why? Because it's the deepest impulse of a Jewish soul to pull at the very fabric of life, till there's nothing left but a thread. They want nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end."}

So I am here stuck at the Chazz because I gave away my last $20 that my parents been known to me to two black people as per the request of our leaders. So I figured you know a good way to start making a little bit of money so I can eat and drink water because I'm not allowed to touch any of the black people stuff. I thought you know I could just start a Chazzercise class. What a great idea right? So we're just gonna start out with a few little moves. I'm going to show you how they go. So our first move we're going to be doing is we're going to take a knee and then we're going to throw out the commie fist. So let's do it. One, two, three, take a knee, commie fist. Take a knee, commie fist. Two more. Take a knee, commie fist. And take a knee, commie fist. Beautiful people, beautiful. So the next one we're going to be working shoulder mobility. So we are going to take our hand, we're going to reach back for our wallets, we're going to take them out and we're going to hand them to black people. Okay other side, take out your wallet, hand them to the black people. Good job everybody. Okay so this one we're going to be working the core. Core is very important especially when you're running from the popo. So we're going to put our hands up like this and every time we see a non-white walking by we're going to bow down. We're going to bow down if you want to increase the intensity a little bit you can even throw up a knee as you're bowing down. Just don't bow down to any white person okay or your supremacist Nazi. Okay anyways we're going to move on now. Our next move is punch a Nazi. So you can either punch a Nazi in real life or you can just shadow box you know just pretend there's a Nazi there and uh you know just stop uh stop white supremacist in these tracks. Okay our last move is going to be the invisible backpack. Now many of you probably don't know what I'm talking about but it is your invisible backpack of white privilege that you are carrying around with you everywhere you go. Nobody can see it, nobody knows what's in it, what it's made up of so we're just going to put that invisible backpack on which you have. Don't question me and we're going to do some squats with all of that white privilege on your back that's just weighing you down. Just get rid of it. Give away your privilege, give away your money, give away your life. So I hope everybody enjoyed my Chaser size class if you want to donate. Yo cracker what you doing? Just doing a Chaser size class Tyrone just trying to you know earn a little money so I can eat. Chas? We don't call it Chas no more it's called chop like chopping off the heads of white supremacists. Oh yeah that's so cool yeah totally okay um so let's add one more move right why not so this one is going to be called the chop. I'm gonna go down I'm gonna chop chop off the white people's heads and white supremacy.

{"vid": "hate_video_428", "transcript": "Oh useless eaters. As your unqualified, non-elected global human health overlord, I'd like to take this opportunity to flaunt my position of power and influence over society and share some of my plans for you and your future. When I amassed my fortune in computer software, I demonstrated that I was willing to lie, steal code, cheat my partners, and exercise monopolistic control to destroy my competitors. Now that I've retired, I can rebrand myself as a humanitarian with my full profit foundation mask rating as a charity. I can advocate for population reduction and sponsor mass human experiments with unproven vaccines in vulnerable populations. Like my father, a powerful banker, eugenicist, and Rockefeller crony himself, it's always been my ambition to decide who lives and more importantly, how many have to die. Whether it's under the guise of climate change or world health, it's really all about controlling and culling the human herd for fun and profit. In November of last year, I hosted Event 201, a war game simulation of a global pandemic. Leaders from private corporations, global banks, governments, and the media got together to strategize ways they could align in lockstep when responding to a worldwide health crisis. Using a coordinated campaign of fear mongering, intimidation, social shaming, and economic blackmail, we realized that we could get around dangerous philosophies like individual liberty and national sovereignty. With an obedient population, we would be free to implement our own top-down solutions like forced quarantines, social distancing, contact tracing, and mandatory testing as a means to seize technocratic control of society. Now imagine my excitement when we had the opportunity to declare our own global pandemic. It was my chance to look like the Nostradamus of public health and to position myself in business partners like Dr. Fauci as the de facto authorities on response and solutions. Through exaggerated doomsday scenarios and computer simulations, our petty control freaks instituted harsh rules and draconian lockdowns. Even after our dire predictions proved false, scared and well-meaning people continued to submit to the arbitrary and foolish demands of their so-called leaders. Having achieved global lockdown and medical martial law, we'll continue to hold hostage your ability to congregate, work, travel, or do just about anything until we're prepared to roll out our bigger plan. I'd like to call this pandemic one because believe me, we have others in the works. Our final solution is to have you begging for us to vaccinate, tag, and digitally track each one of you like livestock. Not only will my foundation enjoy legal immunity and trillions in profits, but these mandatory experimental vaccines will move us so much further down the road to absolute centralized global control. If only my good friend Jeffrey Epstein had been here to celebrate with me aboard the Lolita Express. So remember, global citizens, this will end when I say it ends. Could be a year, maybe two years, maybe never. I guarantee that if we have our way, it'll be at least until you're not able to do anything to stop it. Just surrender your personal freedom and common sense to our fear merchants and government and the media because none of this works unless you all go along with it. Now, feel excuse me, I'm off to do some augmented reality spirit cooking with Marina Abramovich. Bye now."}

High witness news reporter Matt Petrillo is there and Matt that suspect was just arraigned this morning. That's right he's charged with deviate sexual intercourse of a child. Authorities tell us those assaults happened at this daycare behind me over several years. Did Zimmerman work here? No. A woman who answers the door at a lot like home daycare near Allentown says 22 year old Zachary Zimmerman did not work there before slamming the door. We approve the charges. But Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin says Zimmerman sexually assaulted three girls there. High witness news found the daycare is located at the home where Zimmerman lived. Any time a child is a victim of sexual assault it's repugnant. It's unfortunate obviously and it's a crime. Zimmerman faces deviate sexual intercourse with the child charges. He allegedly assaulted three children over and over again from 2011 to 2017. But Zimmerman kept under the radar of Whitehall Township police until this year when the victims came forward. During one instance reported to police in July, victim one disclosed that when she was approximately 10 years old in 2011, Zachary Zimmerman kissed her on the mouth, made victim one perform oral sex on him. Victims came forward in July, June and April. Why were charges just filed? Because it was an investigation. We don't just file charges immediately. We investigate. And Zachary Zimmerman was arraigned this morning. He was taken to the Lehigh County jail after not being able to post a $75,000 bail.

{"vid": "non_hate_video_12", "transcript": "But into March I realized that locking down wasn't necessary. In fact, I was so naive at the time, I had no idea. I thought I would call a few people, had some connections with the medical community, pretty extensive actually in my state. And I thought I could call around and let people know, like, hey, we've got a strategy here. It's not bad. We can prophylax and we could use hydroxychloroquine as a first line therapy. We don't need to lock down. We can protect our elderly with prophylaxis, really low doses. And I actually thought that that was actually going to be well received. Instead I was told to go home and don't use the personal protective equipment because I was just wasting resources. And I literally was on the phone. I won't say who it was, but a fairly well high up person in our society in Texas on one of the boards. And I told him, I said, how old are you? He said, I'm 40 something. I said, look, I've been through the AIDS epidemic. We didn't know if we touched the patients, what was going to happen. And I go, I've been through another. That pandemic itself was very eye opening for me. I was very scared. I was a young doc. And I didn't go home. I went to work. I went to work. I'm going to see patients. I told them right then, I said, look, I don't mean to hurt your feelings, but as far as I'm concerned, you're a coward. You go home. You go home. I said, I'm not going home. I'm going to work. I go, I did six years in the ER, 100, 200 hours a month. I've been on a bunch of trauma teams. I'm not going home. I'm going to see patients. So that turned into short visits with some of my friends, some of my patients who would call me knowing that I'd talked to them about this disease. And I ended up treating the disease. And then I got on a Facebook Live video that in about two hours reached 100,000 people. And I saw it. And I was like, oh my god, I'm going to get some repercussions. Sure enough, I did. The board came calling. And they said, you said that hydroxychloricin works. And you're basically a public menace. And we want to know who you treated. You said at the time it was really early on. I said, treat three patients. And I had to provide all the records, all the information. I was very intimidated, as you might imagine, because I have to practice. I have to feed my family. I love what I'm doing. But I'm not independently wealthy. I was a little bit afraid, really was. That lasted about a day. At that point, again, as Simone, as Dr. Gold said, we've got to do the right thing for the patients. And at the time, I wrote a bunch of letters saying, I'm not going to let my patients get on vents and neck moats. It's not going to happen. I'm not going to allow it to happen. I'm going to treat them. I don't care. Well, suffice it to say, I got reprimanded. I'm still in a process of negotiation with that whole thing. But as Dr. Armstrong said, I'm really not afraid. I know I'm doing the right thing. I've treated a number of patients. I won't tell you how many, because then I'll probably have to provide records for all that. So for the purposes of this statement, I'm going to say I treated three. OK. So the fear of reprisal is the reason why we're in this place right now. Docs don't want to do this. There's a fear of reprisal. I was very worried about it. And I can tell you all the people who believe in this medication, who believe in early treatment, feel the same way. They're really scared to go forward and treat patients because they don't want to lose their medical license. And that's a big deal. So the intimidation is a big deal. Mr. Jordan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Doc Fauci, do protests increase the spread of the virus? Do protests increase the spread of the virus? I think I can make a general statement. Well, half a million protesters on June 6th alone. I'm just asking, that number of people does it increase the spread of the virus? Crowding together, particularly when you're not wearing a mask, contributes to the spread of the virus. Should we limit the protesting? I'm not sure what you mean. How do we say limit the protesting? Should the government limit the protesting? I don't think that's relevant to... Well, you just said if it increases the spread of the virus, I'm just asking, should we limit it? Well, I'm not in a position to determine what the government can do in a forceful way. Well, you make all kinds of recommendations. You make comments on dating, on baseball, and everything you can imagine. I'm just asking, you just said, protests increase the spread. I'm just asking, should we try to limit the protest? No, I think I would leave that to people who have more of a position to do that. I can tell you. The government's stopping people from going to church, Dr. Fauci. Last week in the Calvary Chapel case, five liberals on the Supreme Court said it was okay for Nevada to limit church services. I mean, Justice Gorsuch said it best. He said, there's no world in which the Constitution permits Nevada to favor Caesar's palace over Calvary Chapel. I'm just asking, is there a world where the Constitution says you can favor one First Amendment Liberty protesting over another, practicing your faith? I'm not favoring anybody over anybody. I'm just making a statement that's a broad statement that avoid crowds of any type no matter where you are, because that leads to the acquisition and transmission. And I don't judge one crowd versus another crowd. When you're in a crowd, particularly if you're not wearing a mask, that induces the spread. It's a simple question, Dr. Should we limit the protest? Government is obviously limiting people going to church. And look, there's been no violence that I can see at church. I haven't seen people during a church service go out and harm police officers or burn buildings. But we know that, I mean, for 63 days, nine weeks it's been happening in Portland. One night in Chicago, 49 officers were injured. But no limit to protest, but boy, you can't go to church on Sunday. What was this? I don't know how many times I can answer that. I'm not gonna repine on limiting anything. I'm just gonna tell you. You've repined on a lot of things, Dr. Fauci. Yeah, but I've never said. I mean, something that directly impacts the spread of the virus. And I'm asking your position on the protest. Yeah, well, I'm not gonna repine on limiting anything. I'm telling you what it is, the danger. And you can make your own conclusion about that. You should stay away from crowds, no matter where the crowds are. Government has stopped people from going to work. In fact, just in New Jersey four days ago, Ian Smith, Frank Trumbetta were arrested for opening up, trying to operate their business, their gym. They were arrested. But my bet is if these two individuals who owned this gym were outside just in front of their gym and all the people who were working out in their gym were outside protesting, they'd been just fine. But because they were in the gym working out actually running their business, they got arrested. You think that's okay? You know, I'm not gonna repine on who gets arrested and who does not. I mean, you get where I'm going. I'm telling you, as a public health official, do you see the inconsistency though, Dr. Fauci? There's no inconsistency, Congressman. What, there's no inconsistency. So you're allowed to protest millions of people on one day in crowds yelling, screaming, but you try to run your business, you get arrested. And if you stood right outside of that same business and protested, you wouldn't get arrested, you don't see an inconsistency there? I don't understand what you're asking me as a public health official to opine on who should get arrested or not. That's not my position. You could ask me as much as you want. No, you've advocated for a certain business. You've advocated for certain businesses to be shut down. I'm just asking you on your position on the protest. I mean, I haven't seen one, we've heard a lot about hair salons. I haven't seen one hairstylist who between haircuts goes out and attacks police or set something on fire. But we've seen all kinds of that stuff during protests and we know the protests actually increased the spread of the virus. You've said that. I said crowds. I didn't say specifically. I didn't say protest to anything. So the protests don't increase the spread of the virus? I didn't say that you're putting words in my mouth. No, I just want an answer to the question. Do the protests increase the spread of the virus? I don't have any scientific evidence that anything. I can tell you that crowds are known, particularly when you don't have a mask, to increase the acquisition and transmission. No matter what the crowd is. So you don't have a position on whether the protest increased the spread of the virus or don't increase the spread of the virus? I'm saying that crowds, wherever the crowds are, can give you an increased probability that there's gonna be acquisition and transmission. But do you understand Americans' concern? Protesting, particularly according to the Democrats, is just fine, but you can't go to work, you can't go to school, you can't go to church. There's limits placed on all three of those fundamental activities, first amendment activities, but protesting is just fine. The gentleman's time has expired, but I will just ask the gentleman to just think about his question and put it in reference to crowds that yell at political meetings at fundraisers without masks on an all rig in Texas. Nobody wearing a mask, nobody's social distancing, but a fundraiser. Would that be problematic? With that, I'll yield five minutes to Mr. Foster."}

Our committee will judge the records and according to who they're by, if they can't tell by looking at the name of the record whether it's a nigger singer or a nigger version of this rock and roll box, they'll play the record and then just use their judgment and whether it should come off or not.

Seven News has learnt the headmaster there is now under fire for using a racist slur at a school assembly. Words are a matter of principle for this Brighton College educator. We're looking for not just what has been communicated, but how it's been communicated. But his words have landed him in hot water using a racist slur not once, but three times at school assembly. Mission Brown Papers are actually called a m*** brown paper. Ooh! Oh, yeah, it was. Richard Minnack used the N-word in the wake of the Christchurch terror attack to highlight insidious racism. So Mission Brown Papers are only a tiny step in language away from the m*** brown paper. Oh, no, I'm not saying. 1,400 students were there, including the boy who egged Senator Fraser Anning. Many gasped in shock. You can't say that in front of a school, especially a school as multicultural as ours. Mr Minnack later emailed students to apologise and explain. I hope you understand that I used it to call out and criticise racism and bigotry. Sometimes we have to use offensive words to explain why they are offensive. But now the slur is being used in the playground. I think their theory behind it is if the principal can say why can't we? Late today, the Education Department told 7 News principal Minnack should not have used what they called the offensive word. A spokesperson says he will now be reminded by the department to use appropriate language. Mike."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_48", "transcript": "Hi folks, my perspective here. In this clip I want to analyse a bit of TV programming that was broadcast in the clip. They had a laser beam and a boat. As the boat went further away from the laser beam over a body of water, the projected mark went higher and higher as the boat went away. This was an indication that the water was curved and so therefore we live on a ball and not a flat earth. So listen carefully, this is part of the program where they tell you about what they're doing and we're going to analyse this. Just three miles away the laser seems to have risen by six feet but we know the beam is level so that suggests that the lake is now six feet lower. To see a six foot drop when everything looked flat to me was kind of mind boggling. It kind of shattered my perspective in about one second and made me rethink what was going on. Guys, if the laser is three metres on the boat and the laser is a straight line it has to be three metres off the ground. Because it's a straight line. That's what they're claiming. If it's a straight line the laser also has to be three metres off the ground if there's a bulge in the middle. Because that's what they're saying. If the laser is below that means the boat has to be bigger. The boat would have to increase in its size for the laser to project onto the boat. You see you can't have a lopsided bulge between the boat and the laser. In fact these people, the whole show is fake. The whole thing is a lot of rubbish. If you move the boat and the laser, if you move the laser 20 degrees to your right, the boat is the same distance from the laser you'll get a different reading. You can't have a bulge of water between yourself and the boat because at this angle you'll have a different reading. So even if they say to you, well no you just move the bulge forward now, see problem solved. Well you know, I know that the bulge can't follow the laser and the bulge can't follow the boat. But this stuff is fake. It's not a real science. It's propaganda. But we know the blemish level. But we know the blemish level. But we know the blemish level. But we know the blemish level. But we know the blemish level. We'll go on a helicopter. Sounds like a plan. So now these globalist propagandists, what they're doing is they swap the boat for a helicopter and the laser for a telescope. And they're telling the helicopter to fly out further. And now they're going to make the helicopter drop below the curve of the water. Now think about this. How ridiculous this is. This is supposed to be a science lesson to prove that the water is curved. Think about how stupid this is. This is so insane. It's a joke. So the helicopter drops below the line of sight. How can the trees still be above the helicopter? And the mountains still be in the same place. Because it's simple. The helicopter needs to fly from right to left. And you would see it go below the bulge. And then you'd see it reappear on the left side of the bulge. Don't understand. Or otherwise the bulge of water in front of them is a tube. Don't understand how stupid this whole thing is. This whole experiment is just propaganda. It's fake. It's nonsense. Perception is still it's a flat lake. But it's not a flat lake. It's not a flat lake. That was crazy. I was definitely blown away by the fact that the laser was that high off the water. Look this is a deer. These animals, when the lake freezes over, they can get stuck. Once they lose their footing, they try to get up and then eventually they lose strength. They become weak. And unfortunately if they don't rescue them in time, they have to put the animal down. So the issue is, if there's a bulge of water, if the water is bent, this animal would never be able to get stuck in the middle of the lake. Because it would just slide down. Because remember in the experiment, the two shores are on the same line. And now do you understand how ridiculous their claim is? You see wolves walk across the lake. When the lake is frozen, people ice skate on the lake. Think about it. Could this lady skate on a ball, an ice ball that is spinning at 1,600 km an hour and hurtling through space at 110,000 km an hour? And these people just willingly just skate calmly on a bulge of frozen water. Just think. Or is it propaganda? What do your eyes see? What does your mind tell you? And what are they telling you? They're telling you the truth? Or is it propaganda? You need to think about these things. You see, is the media being controlled? If the media is being controlled, you need to think about what you watch. If you're watching violent programs, if you're playing violent TV games, it's going to make you violent. If you watch stupid, it's going to make you stupid. Don't watch TV blindly and blankly with a blank mind because you're allowing them to program you. So, R-E-M, the band R-E-M rapid eye movement, only happens when you're forced to sleep. So, what are they telling you? They're showing that for a campus to work, the earth has to be flat. Everybody's on the same plane. They're also pointing out something in a bad direction. Where's north? It's not in the middle. You need to think about that. So, at least they had the courage and the strength to go against the flow and say, something's wrong. You see, we're not being told the truth. The people who control the system, the truth and what is right and justice isn't on the agenda. Manipulation and deceit is what they do. So I hope this makes you think and cheers and thanks for watching."}

I'm from Pittsburgh and on Monday I lost my job, ending the first period of financial stability I've ever had in my life. When I joined DSA, I had less than $5 to my name and I was homeless. I joined DSA after a comrade who's actually here today, thank you, Crystal, paid my dues for me. I was between jobs and had just dropped out of college for the second time. I was lost, scared, and suicidal. DSA meetings became my rock. Pittsburgh is deeply committed to snacks at meetings, which I am deeply thankful for, as those were among the rare meals I was able to count on. CB23 also removes the only gendered language in our constitution and would make sure that the DSA constitution is inclusive of gender non-conforming and non-binary comrades. As a co-author of CB23, I've been asked, why don't we just make dues arbitrarily small, something like $5, a cup of coffee? Please hear me when I say that when you have 86 cents to your name and no groceries to eat, $5 is insurmountable. I have also been asked if this would create a system of paper members who join but don't contribute. Please hear me when I say that a socialist organization should value its members because of how much they're able to contribute, we should not value because of how much they're able to contribute, we should value them because our lives are inherently important. Please hear me when I say that nobody is too poor for DSA and please vote yes on CB23."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_57", "transcript": "I think it's primarily a misinterpretation, an intentional misinterpretation of Dr. King. His non-violence was strategic. It wasn't that violence wasn't necessary, it was that we couldn't win with violence. We couldn't get our agenda accomplished with violence. America is showing us something totally different right now. It is saying we will not pay you any attention until you burn something down. And that's not our fault. If it was up to me, Glenn, if it was up to me, I would be somewhere writing a book right now. We're zipping a mimosa, doing all the cosmopolitan things that we have all been accustomed to and programmed to desire and want. But America is signaling to us that we will not give you any attention. We will not pay any attention to your grievances unless you are burning something down. So the strategy inherently has to change. And then even still, I want to correct myself a little more, it wasn't until they saw the violence of Bloody Sunday that well-meaning liberals were actually kicked into gear to say, okay, we have to do something. So it really is a condemnation of the United States of America that in order for us to have any type of meaningful change, violence has to be attached to it. And maybe that's the curse of America being such a violent nation."}
{"vid": "non_hate_video_58", "transcript": "Now, how do I know that the white people know that we are going to come up with a solution to the problem? I know it because they have retina scans, they have what they call racial profiling, DNA banks, and they're monitoring our people to try to prevent the one person from coming up with the one idea. And the one idea is how we are going to exterminate white people because that, in my estimation, is the only conclusion I have come to. We have to exterminate white people off of the face of the planet to solve this problem. Now, I don't care whether you clap or not, but I'm saying to you that we need to solve this problem because they are going to kill us. And I will leave on that. So we have to just set up our own system and stop playing and get very serious and not be diverted from coming up with a solution to the problem. And the problem on the planet is white people.

{"vid": "non_hate_video_59", "transcript": "Someone's stalking us. Hey buddy, why you following us? Ow! Ow! Did you just stab him? Whoa, he just stabbed him dude! In this video, we get to watch some Antifa beat up an Antifa before dragging his ass down to the police who arrest him for stabbing Black Rebel. That last part's not funny, but it is funny watching Antifa beat up other Antifa and getting them arrested. In the middle of a riot that's all about, you know, we hate the police, that's what it's all about, right? The police are racist, we're having a riot against the police. They dragged one of their own to the police after beating him up. This is so great. But the stabbing part is not. Anyway. Yeah, feel free to use whatever you need, Justin, on my page. You don't even have to ask. I won't come after you later for it. Again, like I said, you do good work. I appreciate it. Well, alright, thanks, cool. And likewise to you too, I appreciate what you do for America as does my wife, right Tabby? Hell yeah. He's out there driving around America doing his thing and just, you know, basically he's, he's kind of like a cheerleader for America. I mean, it's challenging everybody's narrative too, even my own. I don't quite understand. But I respect the guy, that's for sure. So if you folks don't already know, Drew aka Black Rebel was stabbed in Portland at night, 55, 56 or so of rioting, straight rioting, apparently by an antipypetophile. And wow, we're hearing more and more and more antipypetophiles these days. I don't know what's going on there. Anyway. Are they actually showing their concolors then? Yeah, maybe they're feeling bold enough to just be open about it. I'm not sure. But for more details on what happened here at the stabbing, see the link below for part one and also see the links below to Drew's channel, Black Rebel. And maybe at some point there will be a link to a GoFundMe or some other fundraiser for Drew, if you may need it for hospital bills and or to pay a bill for this rental car. We'll get into that later. But here we go with part two. Let us have a look at Drew's Twitter. I have not looked at this yet. I want to make something clear. Um, go ahead. Is there a weapon in there? Is he got a gun in there? Is he fucking playing with his dick in there? I don't know. He's doing something. He's following us. That's going to get even me a fucking problem. Yeah, especially because we know. And Drew may be a little physically aggressive with the slap on the fucking shoulder as he hugged him. But that's what you do when somebody is fucking stalking you. You make damn sure everybody in public knows you're talking to this piece of shit. That's what Drew did. Yeah. This man, this, I'm sorry, I'm not going to call him a man. This fucking pervert, this Antifa pervert, stalked them, hunted him and waited for the most opportune moment to try and murder him. That's what happened. Antifa are a bunch of opportunistic fucking cowards and murderers. And they also like sticking their body parts in children. And Drew's timeline at 9.59 p.m. on the 24th, Haley Adams, you folks may remember Haley Adams from Portland's Liberation, tweeted, Stop targeting black and Latino people, you racist piece of shit. And by the way, Haley is supposed to be a white Nazi, even though she's at least part Jewish, I think. But here we have a white Jewish Nazi concern with black people and Latino people. Wow. Anyway, stop targeting black and Latino people, you racist piece of shit. We all know how you guys love through salt and beat on people of color in Portland. She's absolutely right. Didn't I just say that a short while ago? At Space Force USA, that's Drew. And at Deplorable Low, that's Jen Low, life matters. In other words, she's saying this black man and this brown woman's life matters. Put an end to terrorism and racism. Leave my friends alone, communist scums. And then she linked to the tweet that has since been protected by Twitter. Because they like to protect these kind of people. We see you, Twitter. We see you. We see you, Jack. You're not Twitter. You're child rapist syndicate. That's what it is. Because Twitter loves their pedophiles. Oh yeah, they do. They just, oh God, we've got all the pedophiles on the plant right here. Twitter. Oh, and TikTok. TikTok is number two on who has the most pedophile. Yeah, but Twitter is, Twitter considers child rape to be a sexual orientation. Yes, they're lumping in gay people and bisexual people with child rapists. And we're the people who are wrong. We're the ones that apparently don't sympathize with the gay or trans community. And I do. And I don't think that you lumping them in with fucking child rapists is a fair thing to do. Because I have gay friends. They don't rape children. I have trans friends. They don't rape children. You know why? Because they're decent human beings. They're just a little different. Yeah. You assholes are perverts. Rape is not a sexual orientation. It is not. It's perverted, disgusting, and I don't care how you swing it. You should fucking be chopped into pieces and put a fox and sunk to the bottom of the ocean. Dirt bags. Yeah. Now, what else? I feel like there was something else I wanted to go over. Okay, we got to go back to this. But that was on the 24th. And the stabbing, by the way, happened on the 24th. So they threatened these people, threatened to do it, and then they did it. And I challenge any of you people out there to find any examples of Antifa denouncing this. I'll wait. So it was at 3.35 a.m. last night, the 25th, that Drew tweeted this, all of you guys who attacked the Seattle preacher, wow, this is scary foreshadowing. This is scary. Before he got stabbed, he was talking about all of you guys who attacked the Seattle preacher, and folks hopefully you know about that. And by the way, there was a black man killed in another city, a black Trump supporter killed in another city in Milwaukee. Thank you, Tabby. And I have not even had time to look into that other than just hearing about it. I'll give you a small thing. He's a black pro-Trump supporter. He's very vocal about it. He stands on the same corner with his signs pasted all over a building. And I think it was yesterday, or was it today? It was yesterday. He got in a scuffle over some asshole trying to steal his signs, some anti-Trump delusional fuck wit, most likely a BLM, trying to steal his signs. And he fought back and they shot him. And he died. Yeah. He died for what he stood for. And you know what? Brave man. Brave man. And I hope whoever fucking killed him dies in the most horrendous way humanly possible. And if I get, if I'm lucky, and I worked the odds of the fucking lotto, that's some of a bitch will drop into my hands. That's what I want. That's what I want. That's not okay. It's not okay. But anyway, Black Rebel tweeted this, all of you guys who attacked the Seattle preacher, that mace was brought to you by the courtesy of the Black Rebel. And then we have people saying, oh yeah, well then you deserve to be stabbed. Okay. Yeah. 11 hours ago from when I'm recording this, 6.02am, he tweeted I got stabbed in Portland and I on my way to the hospital. And we have an Instagram link and it's basically just the same thing. Okay. So I don't need that. All right. Now let's have a look at this tweet by Drew from 821am on the 25th. All right. You guys, I got stabbed. I'm on my way to the hospital. Are you stabbed, honey? I don't know what it is. Why are you stream on Twitter? Make sure y'all share this. Yes. I don't know how bad it is. Okay. I just want to get off of here in the morning. But I'm on the way to the hospital. Some of the people do that was falling on the phone. So I'm hoping to ask them what happened and he stabbed me. So I'll keep you guys updated. So there you go folks. This is what things are coming down to. Let's look at what else he's got here. This is probably from the undisclosed hospital bed. Twitter is to blame for a lot of the senseless attacks against conservative journalists. They remove alt-right groups but refuse to recognize the doxing by alt-left or domestic terrorist groups like Antifa who openly encourage this type of violence every day. And it's not just alt-right. It's everybody who's not far left that they find. If they find them, oh, there is one. It's like from Pink Floyd's The Wall. There is one up and then get him up against the wall. There is one in the spotlight. He doesn't think right. Get him up against the wall. That one is black and he refrains the toe of the line. Make an example of them all. And there are women of color not following and not fitting in our box. Get her up against the wall if I had. And there, that one's a Jew. They have a tactu. That one's got spots. If I've had my way, I'd have all of them shot. And I'm sure they would. What have we here? Drew is retweeting Anteanose tweet where he says, if the dog beats a man in the middle of downtown Portland, they say he stabbed someone. Oh, okay. Let's look at this then. Come on. The funny thing is, some of these people who are gang-stopping this guy, they're going to find out that they were beating up a fellow Antifa. And that he's a pedo. And that he stabbed the black guy. And they're going to be so confused. Wait, did I do a good thing by beating him up or not? I can't tell. Did I just beat up a freedom fighter who fights against black Nazis? Or did I beat up a white Nazi who claims to be fighting against black Nazis or not? I mean, he's a pedo. Did I do a good thing? Do I do a bad thing? Did I attack one of my own or are they not one of my own? Yeah. That's how morally bankrupt these people are. Moving on, let's see what else we got here. And another tweet by Andy Noe, retweeted by black rebel with the message, I'm glad people stepped in to drag my attacker to the police. He's currently sitting on a $250,000 bail for felony assault. Is this the same video? More chaos in those days? No, different video. So Andy Noe's tweet is more chaos in the streets of downtown Portland at the riot. Some person is dragged away. Bitch! Yeah, take him to the car. There you go. Now what else we have here? Black rebel 48 minutes ago as of my time. So that's around 6 p.m. Eastern or 3 p.m. Pacific. I'm in Portland because it's a free country and he's responding to this here. Let's see what this is. This is a tweet by mosaic2g2. I'm sorry, I don't know who that is. Richard Blake Hampey was arrested on $250,000 bond. You wrote $250 bond. Why was the quote black rebel unquote in Portland? That's the shit that wait, I'm hearing in 5, 4, 3, 2, QAnon. Fox News Axios will probably have him on instead of the man whose head was split with a rubber bullet. Okay, well, you know, it's not entirely coherent with this guy's trying to say. They're not always that literate, but I think we get the idea. Basically, he deserved it because he was there. He was a black man who dared to disagree with them in their town. How fucking tolerant of you fucking bigots. And that person was responding to this by block, block button on limited who tweeted hearing a black man was stabbed by a character clad in all black. Well, he wasn't who was chased to 711, but the police came and the man couldn't quite escape. Can anyone verify this? Feel free to DM me. Maybe they're talking about a different incident. I'm not sure, but this guy is apparently talking about Richard. So yeah, he deserved it is what this person is saying. But black rebels response drew his response to the question of what were you doing in Portland is I am in Portland because it's a free country. You people don't understand this is fucking America. You don't get to own a town and say get the fuck out of our town that we've heard Antica say for years now. Get out of our town, get out of Portland, get out of Berkeley, get out of this. It's not yours. It's not fucking yours. Okay. Oh, and then at the same time they have the gall to be like open borders, open borders, get the fuck out of our town, get the fuck out of our town. I mean, we've even put videos out showing them saying get the fuck out. You do not have that right. You can leave if you don't like it. You have that choice. You don't have to, but you can, but you don't get the force anybody out or keep anybody out. Go fuck yourself. All right, folks, I want to wrap this up. Sorry that this has gone on so long and sorry that I'm putting this out so late. I am working with subpar equipment, subpar connection, everything's slow. My connection's slow. My computer's slow. My microphone and your head doesn't work half the time, blah, blah, blah, blah. Oh, oh, it's me. Who cares? Who cares? But listen, Drew is probably going to need financial help. Okay. But we have more to come out about this from Drew himself and et cetera. Be careful out there. Tonight in Portland, it's probably going to be a lot worse. In fact, I will be surprised if nobody dies tonight. All right, folks, stay safe out there. Make sure that you squash the street Nazis. Make sure you subscribe. There was some bichutes so you can hear what we really think about all this that we can't tell you on YouTube. Thanks very much for watching everyone. And Drew man, heal fast. So all I got to say and Jen low, stay safe. All right, folks. Thanks for watching."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_67", "transcript": "Today we're going to be looking at one of the justifications given from Muhammad's marriage to 6 year old Aisha. Let's go ahead and watch the video. Now let us look at the fruit that came from the tree so we can understand it. Who was Aisha Radhiva Anha? She is the woman that memorized the Quran. When the Quran was revealed, when the last ayats of the Quran, the last 6,636 ayats were revealed. Three months later Aisha had memorized the whole Quran. Think about that. Secondly, let's look at Aisha Radhiva Anha. Aisha Radhiva Anha because she lived with the Prophet ﷺ. She saw him, she understood him intimately, clearly. Her mind was bright and she was a powerful young girl. A very aggressive young girl. Powerful, aggressive and deep and intelligent. Memorized the whole Quran and guess what? She was holding with her when the Prophet ﷺ passed away at least 2,600 Ahadith that nobody else knew. That's why after Abu Hurairah, nobody related to us more hadith than Aisha Radhiva Anha. So the justification given for Muhammad's marriage to a child is that Aisha was able to memorize the Quran within a matter of months and also that because she knew the Prophet so intimately, she was able to provide many of the hadith that are now used to assist Muslims in determining how to live their lives in a way that is pleasing to Allah. However, is this sufficient justification for Muhammad marrying a child and making child marriage a part of the Islamic religion? Was there no other way that the Quran could be recorded or the hadith collected? And of course, the obvious answer is no. There are many different ways that the Quran could have been recorded and preserved that did not involve child marriage. For example, Allah could have simply invented a pen given one of his followers some paper and taught them how to read and write. In my opinion, that would have been a much more moral way to preserve the Quran. But let me know what you think in the comment section. If you like this video, hit the like button, subscribe, hit the notification button and I'll see you in the next video where I'll be giving a slightly more serious and in-depth analysis of another of the justifications of child marriage in the Islamic religion."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_84", "transcript": "Senator, you called the alleged attack on Justice Smollett a modern day lynching when it happened. Now police sources are telling many networks that Mr. Smollett is under a potential investigation for, you know, concocting a story and paying these men. Is it time to revisit what you said about these remarks? What is your feeling on potential hopes, hate crimes in general? Well, the information's still coming out and I'm going to withhold until all the information actually comes out from on the record sources. We know in America that bigoted and biased attacks are on the rise in a serious way. We actually even know in this country that since 9-11 the majority of the terrorist attacks on our soil have been right-wing terrorist attacks. The majority of them white supremacist attacks from the horrific shootings in Pittsburgh or in South Carolina church. What we're seeing is attacks on people because they're different and we all need to join together and condemn those attacks and the hatred and the bigotry that sources them. But would you think it's time for Mr. Smollett to address this more publicly though given what's happened? Again, I'm following this in the news as you are and we'll see what happens. But what in the risk of, you know, a hoax of attack, wouldn't that be a detriment to the work that you're trying to do with your anti-lynching bill? Wouldn't that hurt the movements somehow? We have seen painful realities surge in our country, rise in anti-Semitism, anti-Islamic attacks. We're seeing just vicious, horrific, cruel violence that's motivated by bias and hate. We need to do more to protect all Americans and make sure all Americans and communities are safe. Have you spoken with Mr. Smollett? No. Senator, I want to ask you about Amazon because you held"}
{"vid": "non_hate_video_85", "transcript": "Okay, sorry. A few seconds to things I can do. Anyway, this is about Stefan Malinu getting booted from MailChimp and a couple things. And I couldn't find anything else but these really opinionated rags. The Daily Dot and the other one is called News Hub, which is out of New Zealand. Alright, the Daily Dot goes, so I'm not going to read all, I'm just going to read some stuff that's in here. But pretty much he was booted from MailChimp because my God, he has opinions people don't like. And I'll go through here and it goes, hey, at MailChimp, at MailChimp abuse, did you know you power white nationalists except for Malinu's email newsletter? Malinu promotes eugenics, race science, and men's rights activism. Okay, first off, I've listened and seen a lot of his stuff. Not everything, some stuff I'm like, whatever. I don't do his calling show, I think some of the stuff is kind of boring and preachy and I don't agree with everything he says. But he does not promote eugenics. Race science, he has talked about racial differences based on, what is it doing now? That's not what I would. Okay. Oh, this is her getting ratioed. Black guy calling her cowards, Maribor saying I would delete mail. I actually did this by accident. Sixth Exon Hammer, Sixth Exon says, talk about virtue signaling. No research either, just ban. Now, I want to tell you this in my personal opinion, I mean, there's just a lot more. Geez, time to leave MailChimp before they terminate your accounts because US sanctions or something. This guy goes, person goes, well, thank you for taking yourselves out of the running for me and deciding which service I use. I'm not going to volunteer you, sir. That will cancel me to make Twitter happy. And it goes on and on and on. But I'm going to go through this, I don't know, whatever. But, I mean, if you talk about it, I mean, he's talked about it, he's talked about with it from different journals and books that have been written. But he doesn't really go into it. He does talk about certain things and I'm not going to get into it. I'm not here to talk about that. I'm not here to talk about the rights. Oh, my God. Men and women are different. Men and women have different needs and different rights issues. Just like men and women, they have different medical needs. Men get prostate cancer. Women don't because they don't have prostates. Men can get testicular cancer. Women don't get testicular cancer because they don't have testiculars. Yeah, I'm kind of doing this Jeff Fox with the thing. Just like men and women can both get breast cancer, though it mainly affects women. Women can get cancer in the uterus. I think the uterine cancer, that's the one that kind of happens. Everybody in the world, they can't say that one, it's just kind of driving us today. And guys can't get that. They can't get cancer in the uterus because they don't have a uterus. Women have certain medical issues they have to deal with and men have certain medical issues we have to deal with because we're different. Which is an obvious thing. There are certain issues where women have certain rights issues where they're being screwed over because there are women in certain cases and that needs to be addressed. And if men are getting screwed over in certain cases because there are women, that needs to be addressed too. People's rights need to be addressed with their men or women. The fact that he's going to focus more on, we have tons of groups over focusing on women stuff. I'm focusing on women like it's crazy. But the minute you want to focus on how men are getting fucked over, and I do mean fucked over, people throw a fit. And this is great. But the fact that she did this in date, it's more like this was planned. She knew someone. I guarantee you this person knew someone at MailChimp. And this was, I'm telling you, I'm going to guess. My guess is, I think, I don't know for sure. This is my conclusion. This is my guess. I don't know why I came up with the conclusion, but this is what my guess is. She knew someone at MailChimp. And this was a planned thing. This didn't come out of nowhere. Trust me. Because there was someone, she knew at MailChimp, knew that Mike Stephan Mollin knew, but she just had to do something to get the ball rolling. Trust me. And then when they go that, they go, thank you for this. This rules, think, notice that they're using everything about how people like this rules. Like, let me tell you something. If you don't defend the people you disagree with, because there are people out there who disagree, but I agree with their right to say it. Because even people I disagree with, they're once when they come up to you, they're just like, huh, didn't think about that one. But these people are horrible people. And then he goes on to stay later on that if he had to go do the Hugo Struggle fight, he would. Because there's a lot of people that don't like him. If he got hired by a company, that company, they found out they were from that company to get ratioed until they had to fire him. And he is in Canada. It says online provocateur, Steph Amologio is being a real cute over-complaining. He won't be able to find regular appointment after saying provocative things online. Well, it's true because they would look him up and the first thing you look up under Google search is how bad Steph Amologio is. What type of jerk Steph Amologio is. You know, it's pretty much they've stacked the deck against him. Professor Scott Steiner, what am I supposed to do when people Google me, found out about me being a... You know what, first off, if that guy worked for me, he wouldn't have a job for much longer. And then, say this is everything from people who don't... People go... Because what he's trying to say is when you do Google search and the Google algorithm is set up to screw you over, and like it'll take everything people said, you say, but they won't take it completely out of context. And he's got a point that he can't... He's unemployable. But the thing though is, it's like, these are the texts. The good thing is, I live in Texas. And in Texas, let's say I started working for... There's actually some companies I call the ABC, whatever. Let's say I started working for... Let's say I started doing IT work for... I have an IT area. So I started doing IT work for Cisco. I've actually had calls from people that go work at Cisco. I've actually interviewed for Oracle before. But I've actually worked for... I've actually worked for VMware before. I love working for VMware. Great company. Let's say that I got hired for Cisco. And I'm working at Cisco. I'm just there fixing computers. And someone sees some of my stuff online and says, hey, did you know he's a white... He's this, that, and the other. Look what he said. And I get fired and I get put like, oh, because of this. Well, in Texas, I can actually sue that person for tortuous interference of a contract. And in Texas, I can sue that person for contacting Cisco or people for contacting Cisco and getting me released and get money for it and end up to cover my expenses. And then they'll get friggin' slammed. And if they make it so bad that I can't get a job and they poison the wealth for me, I can get tortuous interference of prospective contracts. And in that way, that they have to pay me for what money I might been able to make. I don't know if Canada has such laws. But in Texas, since I'm in Texas, I always say I'm in Texas because of this. In Texas, if they would have done this, if he was in Texas, they would have done this. He, and also, this is also defamation. And the reason why I say defamation, if you come here, this is where it's defamation. They say he supports, promotes eugenics. And this is how he can get them, at least in Texas, for defamation. I'm assuming I'm not a lawyer, don't play on TV, my dad was a lawyer, but nearly. This is just conjecture. This is just guessing a real lawyer could answer this. But I think this would also be a case for defamation. And the reason is, she accused you of doing eugenics. Race science, and then said men rights, doing activision for the rights of men is a bad thing. Therefore, she basically decided he promotes eugenics, by the way, which he doesn't. I'm pretty, which I'm 99% sure he does it. The reason why I never say 100% because there's always that one time, like, oh, I didn't know you supported that. I would never guessed. But he doesn't, he does not. Heck, I don't even support eugenics. Eugenics is a horrible thing. Eugenics, by the way, came from the Democrat Party. There's mainly Democrats who did that crap, not Republicans, and here in the United States. But calling, saying that he supports eugenics, and eugenics, in my opinion, is a horrible thing, is that is defamation. And this non-dini jami, however you say her name, if I did say her name wrong, I'll apologize. I will only apologize for saying people's names wrong because sometimes I'm just trying to guess. Well, this young lady here could get the living crap suit out of her. Okay? And the fact that she's admitting to it, it's like, look, this is what the Vic Mignon case. Now, I know the judge kicked a lot of stuff out, but it's being appealed. Now, I'm telling you on appeal, a lot of stuff's going to come back, and he's pretty much going to, I think he's going to end up winning this case. And in my opinion, you never know. But he's pretty much going to win a lot of the case. So, but yeah, that's about it. If I was Stefan, and if this woman is in Canada, in the United States, there might be not much he can do. But if he was in Canada, he might be able to sue, let's say she's in Canada, if he's in Canada, being a Canadian. Now, I don't know Canadian law. I don't know how it works. But he could sue her for defamation. Basically, we're claiming that because she got him. Now, now I know in the United States for what he did, what she did. This causes you cause damages to this person. All right. And this is where the laws need to be loosened. So it's easier to sue people for doing crap like this. You know, maybe if some of these people were to pay like $100,000 or get a million dollar judgment against them for pulling stunts like this, this would stop. Yeah, not the legal courts were putting her in jail for this, but make her pay the victim a million dollars. Because guess what? What if he comes in discovery and find out that she was working colluding with someone in MailChimp to do this? Well, guess what? If she comes in and sue, she might be able to sue MailChimp. He might be able to sue MailChimp. Maybe not MailChimp, but the person in MailChimp. If I own MailChimp, I would be what the F are you doing? Get the heck out. Like I said, we don't know what's behind us, but like I said earlier, and I don't want to repeat what I said earlier. I'm going to kind of wrap it up now. A, this lady did a tweet. Got Stefan Mollin, removed from MailChimp. I think that she knew someone in MailChimp, but this was a planned action in my opinion. This is my personal opinion. Two, he has, and I believe he has a right to case to sue for defamation and for damages because she defamed him. All right. The problem is why I can't say white nationalist because he might be able to get him for white nationalist because she's saying he's a racist too. And all this stuff saying that he's a racist and please do be genious. He can sue her for defamation and maybe get damages, but depending on what Canadian law says, and she's in the United States. I don't know because you're crossing national borders and this is where it becomes complicated. So, and not to mention because of the damage the left is doing to him because they don't like his views. It's going to be hard for him to find other employment because he makes his money basic as a businessman online. And hey, I don't know how he, he could be doing fine financially for all I know. He could be doing great. I don't know. I don't know how he's doing financially. So, but that's about it. Have any comments below and also that's, and tell me what you think. Right.

Police started using some of those crowd dispersal tactics like tear gas, even playing very loud sounds to push them out.

I'm a poor person, I'm a poor member of DSA. Our chapter is a majority poor chapter. I make no money, but I give everything to DSA. I give 100,000% of my labor to DSA. Members who are poor give 100% of their labor to DSA. We love this organization. This constitution by-laws change would simply redefine how we approach members. We would no longer refer to members as dues-paying members. Some of us can't afford that, but we still give our all to DSA. It would also redefine as a member in good standing, because no matter what we pay or if we can pay, we're still members in good standing. I think maybe some of you have heard me extoll the virtue of poor people's movements. If you read chapter 5, there's an entire story about the National Welfare Rights Organization and the problems that were caused by their dues system. They didn't require dues, some chapters did. It eventually fell apart. I'd like to read just one small paragraph from that. In organizing doctrine, membership means something more than merely formal affiliation through the payment of dues. It also means active participation in the life of the organization. In demonstrations, for example, mass participation is ostensibly the functional equivalent of political resources such as wealth, which interest groups elsewhere in the social structure possess. As organizers sometimes put it, poor people have numbers. Membership, in short, means regular participation by masses of people. Please support this Constitution by-laws change."}

Well, then I don't want anybody like that in the White House. So can I have my car back? And he's still there. I don't know. He signed it. We could go ask. I never knew that. Well, so the whole point of it is though, he's a human being, right? Just like you and me, and shouldn't really matter. That's what... Well, he better read the Bible. He does, and he says that God doesn't choose a political party. Why does it say in the Bible that a man shouldn't marry a woman then? Well, I totally respect your viewpoint on this. I so totally do. But I think that we were not around when I was married. How come this has never been brought out before? It's common knowledge. I never heard it. We can talk to someone if you need to talk to them about this. I don't know the rules on this or not, but I guess what I would like you to just dig deep inside and think, like, should it matter if it's a woman, or if it's a man, or if they're heterosexual or homosexual? If you believe in what they say. That's my question. It all just went right down the toilet. Is where it all just went. And that's... you are... you have a total right to your opinion. I'm not trying to tell you to think otherwise, but we'll ask what they want us to do. But I just ask you to look inside your heart, because you sound like a Christian woman to me, and I'm a Christian woman, and my God wants me to love everybody. I hope so. So you must not believe it then, if you think it's okay for somebody to marry to the same sex person. I think we're just interpreting it different, and that's okay, because everybody gets to have their own beliefs. But what I teach my son is that love is love, and we're all human beings."}

some idea what Boogaloo is but the give you a little backstory Tim pool six months ago was so anti-gun super lefty whatever and I said back then he's just playing it he's just doing it as it's marketing ratings thing nobody can be that stupid gotta stop saying that but uh you go on he do his shtick and do his stories and then he contradict himself and I'd be like a while back I did a video about people who will only go to the edge of the box but never look over the edge and Tim was the perfect example all the evidence would be there right up against the cardboard and you won't look over the edge it's too scary to look over the top of the box piece all that information together so you know what's really going on in the middle the Boogaloo boys so apparently it the left is terrified of these horrible Boogaloo people who want to take over the government and and they're all horrible white extremists supremists and all this other bullshit and I'm listening to this and I'm fucking laughing so you understand and they're all terrified of Civil War just you understand I understand the whole Boogaloo movement and I'm not one of them Boogaloo movement would be something more akin to patriots people who are sick and tired of crap going on in their country they will most likely be center right to right but not super far right these people would be more likely to know the Constitution backwards and forwards than a politician but they're sick and tired of the thermocline today is killer man from windy all day though but three percenters are a thing and the concept of three percent is it only took three percent of the population to overthrow the British in the country three percent tea partiers these guys are the next evolutionary extension except for the fact that they are just people who share the same opinion it's not Antifa it's not the clan these are just Americans who want America to go back to being America without a K understand what I'm saying here these are just people who are sick and tired of watching their country devolve every special interest group gets points over the guy who goes to work every day black lives matter is now a super thing and moron for busy apologizing for shit they never did the rainbow mafia and their strong arm tactics to get their shit put through well you know what well not every gay person is involved in pedophilia there's a large section of the rainbow mafia political movement that backs them you see this come up every now and again and the gay people freaking know it's not us I'm not a bugaloo guy so I can understand but the fact of the matter is this is what's going on here it is shit like this that has pushed the whole concept of bugaloo now pay attention because this is important the whole bugaloo thing is a sigh out being run on you maybe not you in particular but definitely being run on the Karens and the Ivans and the weak-minded sheeple of the planet the libertarians have a great expression we want to take over the government and leave you alone kind of look the bugaloo guys want to do too they want to take over the government restructure it back to the way it's supposed to be and then fuck back off to leave me alone land so the people leave them alone and I can back them to the wall on that no problems with that concept because that's the way it should be but as far as it's an organized movement of white supremacist Nazi racist KKK members and who hate America no no that is exactly not what it is just relax folks unless you have pink hair and wear a vagina hat and streach every time something happens run up to people in the street yell at them for not wearing a mask and do all the other things that are basically the other side up whether turning you into communists if you rat on your neighbors because that's what a good aparachik does then you got something to worry about the bugaloo boys it's a joke it's the next iteration of okay think of it that way ice cubes means fruity but this is stereo now this is all part of the plan sigh up don't fall for it you know those bugaloo guys might be your neighbors if they existed so I'm just gonna go with this I think the bugaloo man only comes for all the bed zoys and zurls who don't rat on your neighbors and wear their masks and eat their tofu kale rainbow maculado whatever the hell those frigging people eat they're not terrorists they're not even real fucking joke I gotta go inside now put my Hawaiian shirt and my pet will cure on and go to the meeting oh folks don't fall for this shit okay we're just terrorizing you for the frigging profit margin I'm gonna do headlights next but this was too funny I had to all right remember if you are gonna bugaloo can't press that Hawaiian shirts gotta have wrinkles in it make sure you match your Hawaiian camo to your environment I haven't had a laugh like that forever wait some premise do not want to take over the gun want to overthrow the

Yeah, that you can't worry about This is a famous Hubert Humphrey quote You can't worry about the working man and not worry about for whom he's going to work You got to be attentive to the fact that without growth We're fighting over a shrinking pot. So at the end of the day, you know, I'm supporting Joe with a whole heart Okay, and I will within this weekend I'm optimistic about how he can actually solve the problems facing our country and bring us together The best way as we were talking about earlier the best way for us to confront a peer competitor in China is to be America again To legislate to solve problems to deal with drug pricing the opening Do you sit alone at like you're sitting alone at lunch now? I've actually got a full lunch table of folks who just don't go on Twitter Okay, I don't know I think you're you know even after this interview I think you're gonna get some dirty looks down there. Are you headed back there today? He said quote we cannot be the party of free stuff. That doesn't work Well, obviously it doesn't work and it's interesting to even see a Democrat agreeing with that Americans realize this and that's why everyone is hopefully not going to vote for whoever the Democratic nominee ends up being because There is no such thing as free stuff Everybody pays for it one way or the other whether it's increased taxes Whether it's taking from the taxpayers and giving it to the ones that aren't working or more than anything else Your freedom You're always gonna pay for it folks.

Joe's fucking awesome man. He's better than you. What the fuck You know, he actually did this. I was trying to watch this. I got 54 minutes in this is how far I got in right last night I just had to keep on stopping like oh Jesus, okay I get it I have a degree in politics and I have to degrees in philosophy So a lot of the concepts are really easy for me But you know what I know they're easy for a lot of people to understand what double-speak is what new speak is to Understand the linguistic games being played by the left when you start watching this and thank God at least Andy Ngo got to tell like his side of the story pretty much ununder uninterrupted Thank God for the first ten minutes and then at the end of it you see Joe Well, this is all really confusing, you know, it's so confusing. It's so no it's not fucking confusing Joe It's confusing because you're trying to play the false center. It's confusing because you've got this false neutrality It's confusing to you because you're not fucking waking up and realizing that you're being manipulated by the left You don't even understand what fucking double-speak is you don't get that that and Tifa are actually pro fascist When I stopped watching it's when Joe Rogan said, you know keeps cutting fucking Andy I will can we get a definition of this and what do you mean by that and what do you mean by this like Joe thinks he's doing like The platonic method or is it the Socratic method where you ask people questions in order to make them realize that maybe their position is wrong But no, you're not doing it right Joe You're asking people questions because you legitimately don't know what the fuck they're talking about Which is so messed up to me because your buddy Jordan Peterson You've talked to him at length a lot of the things that you need to understand about how our world works and has been working Historically politically Conceptually you should have all that stuff in your head Joe, but you don't for some fucking reason is it the weed is it the cryotherapy? I don't know what's doing it to you But at this final point here of 54 minutes in and he says Jamie call up a definition of fascism And I say I can't watch this anymore, you know, okay. Yeah, yeah, mr. James Paus and with your three degrees Yeah, you understand all these concepts fuck off if you don't already have a basic grasp on what fascism means What are you gonna do? Oh Jamie? Could you call it up? What did they do? They called up fucking Wikipedia? They called up they typed into Google and they read the first fucking hit a Form of radical right wing authoritarian Ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power force some of this is correct It is fascism is characterized by dictatorial power forcible suppression of opposition and strong Regimentation society that that's all true, but hey radical right wing not necessarily that is not a necessary Essential part of the definition of definition of fascism never was for some reason. Thank God. Mary and Webster still has the proper definition of Pretty close anyway a political philosophy movement or regimes such as that of fascista that exalts nation and often race above the individual Oh, but James it says nation that's intrinsically right wing Is it are you gonna tell me that Chinese communism for example? It does not exalt nation and race above the individual Are you gonna tell me that so no nationalism and Exalting the nation and being right wing are not intrinsically tied either if that's your only argument to say that fascism is intrinsically right wing That's a pretty fucking weak argument, but anyways anyways, I didn't actually keep watching. I didn't know that they did this I just saw somebody else mentioned it somebody else mentioned it that you know Joe Rogan is spreading around that fucking fake definition of fascism Do I have to tell you this? I'm sure most of you know this that gangs groups of people of leftist academics get together and edit Wikipedia articles That's how Wikipedia works anybody can come in through with a little bit of vetting and edit their articles I'm sure most of you know how unreliable Wikipedia is But maybe a lot of you don't and apparently Joe Rogan doesn't fucking get this and his idiot producer Jamie don't get this It's being used as a tool of new speak They're redefining things in order to change the way that people think if you change the way language works Then you change the way people's thoughts work if you change language you change people's thoughts that's something Understood by leftist. That's why so many leftist so-called historians and politicians alone They have degrees in linguistics and communications known Chomsky a linguistics professor Suddenly becomes a historian. He was never a true historian He was playing fucking games with ideas and language in order to change people's thinking to be further and further to the left and this process Continues and Joe Rogan somehow You think I keep on but they mean dog You fucking Joe Rogan it really pisses me off What a useful idiot he is and that he is such outreach 5.7 million people have watched this now So yeah, I don't know yo yo, he's kind of confusing. Oh what the Joe keep fucking saying also that really drove me nuts in the first 15 minutes 5050 minutes. Yeah, it's just a minority of people though. It's just a minority of people It's just the far the far far left of this and they're the only ones that are violent No, you fucking moron Joe Leftist ideology as it is now so-called extreme leftism, but which encompasses The majority of the left believes all authority flows from the barrel of a gun. This is something so Mount Satan said that Everybody all of their fucking people that they look up to all of the intellectuals like Karl Marx and Mount Satan and Lenin all the rest of them Understood or they believed anyways that no true revolution can come about without violence So no, it's not just a leader. Oh, it's just a minority It's just a minority of them even people in the comments are saying yo I live in Portland and Joe Rogan doesn't fucking understand It's not just a minority of them that are condoning violence In general they see their violence against the right as righteous because it's against the right and That's that and also don't you understand this concept that some people just want to see the world burn don't you understand how fucking lost and and sad and pathetic and and mentally damaged these new generations and Millennials are Though they inherit a lot of that from their boomer from their boomer forbearers And I'm not sure where generation X is in that but they're so angry about the state of affairs And they think that they're so hard done by because they've been taught in university They've been taught even in high school They've been taught even in grade school that they are victims they're victims they're victims and they want change and they want revolution And the only way we can have a revolution is through violence therefore. Yes, we will beat up on this gay Vietnamese man. Yes. Yeah, and then Joe says don't they realize that people are gonna see that and some you know right wingers They're gonna start picking up guns. Yeah, they do know that Joe. That's why they're doing it They're doing it because they want to escalate tensions. They want violence They want a violent conflagration because they believe that that that violence that chaos that anarchy is the fertile soil in which Progress can be had that's how the left thinks Yeah, buddy Jordan must have told you some of this shit Joe It's really confusing. It's really confusing fucking Joe Rogan man. Fuck me Let me give you all a piece of advice Next time you're in a thrift store and you see in old dictionary is the bigger the better and the older the better buy it Buy it and every once in a while check the fucking words and see how they're changing over time But James, that's the nature of language language naturally changes depending on people's usages It used to be that the world word literally actually meant Poetically, but for some people reason a lot of people started using it as if it meant Factually and now people are dead bent on trying to correct people who are actually using it the way that it used to be used But that's okay. I know a lot of you are confused by what I just said Yeah, literally actually was a figurative way of speaking in the past, but anyways, that's just an example But Language is no longer changing in a natural way. It's changing via social engineering Social engineering like these people that go on Wikipedia and change the articles and change the definitions and they omit information Just that video I did two days ago, but Jeffrey Epstein It turns out that they went to Bill Clinton's Wikipedia and they removed anything about Jeffrey Epstein There's all this stuff is going on. It's social engineering. That's not true Progress that's not true evolution of language. You're being manipulated Go to the thrift store and pick up a couple old dictionaries before 1980 preferably and the bigger the better. I Know I'm the only sort of person that reads dictionaries for fun, but trust me. It's worthwhile It's worth what and the other thing it don't maybe you should read the book 1984 and read the book I mean, I know a lot of you are probably tempted just to watch the movie But if you don't understand the concept of new speak, which I just finished talking about socially engineering Language in order to change the way people think intentionally and line with an ideology. That's new speak That's from 1984 if you haven't read George Orwell's 1984 Andy Ingoe brings up double speak the name at the font itself is perfect example of double speak It really is the yeah, they really are the exact opposite of what they say they are. They're not anti fascist They're very much fascists if you understand what they're going for and if you understand what the proper definition is I guess it does get kind of confusing if you're a fucking chimp, right? I guess it does get kind of confusing read 1984 Don't you know watch the movie after if you want but if you actually actually want to understand the concepts of new speak and double speak and and How you know the Ministry of Truth is this building where you go to be fucking tortured and you read it You'll see hey, that's what the left is doing No, it's not on both sides like Joe. I have you say well both sides are kind of guilty Oh, it's only just a little minority. Fuck you Joe. You know you so So fast oh god All right. All right read 1984 pick up an old dictionary and this fucking tool You know, I don't know what to say, you know, I tried to say something Joe doesn't understand the natty-foss intention is to escalate violence They want the right wing quote-unquote to pick up arms. They want things to get out of control. Look at that one like one like Thanks a lot for clicking a watch and check out my patreon and PayPal Linked in the description below and on this Korean right about now I do require one or two dollars and support every month from as many people as possible because a person like me who tells it like it is Has got no hope of gainful regular full-time employment in Canada So thanks a lot for clicking and watching and please please share sharing is so important right now Sharing is so important giving the way YouTube is throttling us. They're doing their third their part, too They're trying to disaparice down the memory hole. Please read 1984. All right. We'll talk to you again real soon. Have a nice weekend. Bye-bye folks"}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_165", "transcript": "But Dr. Steve Pocenick, as we're in the middle of this, the election's over. We're now in the stealing process of the election. What are you seeing, what's going through your mind as you're witnessing this gigantic hoax? Let me just say again, what I said in 2016, there are honorable members of our intelligence, military, and civilian community in the government who understood exactly how corrupt Biden and the Democratic machinery is, was, and will be. This is really a sting operation, contrary to what everybody else said. Trump knew this was happening. Eric knew this was happening and warned the public. I knew this was happening. However, I could not say anything about it. What happened was we marked, watermarked every ballot with what's called the QFS Blockchain Encryption Code. In other words, we know pretty well where every ballot is, where it went, and who has it. So this is not a stolen election. On the contrary, we reversed the entire game of war along the lines of Sun Tzu, the art of war. And Trump was brilliant and still is brilliant at it. The reason he hasn't been seen and Alex correctly said, oh, I haven't seen him in several days. Well, in the art of the war, you pull back, allow your enemy to make all the mistakes that they are making, manipulate the situation, expose them, and then come in for the final killing. And that's what's happening now. None of this was unexpected. All of this was expected. All of this is part of the sting operation we're running. And let me tell you that 48 hours ago, not only did we put markets on those ballots, but I can say now, with the permission of people in the intelligence community and elsewhere, that we have sent out thousands and thousands of national guards to 12 different states, Washington, Delaware, Texas, Arizona, Alabama, and everywhere. So now you have to consider and rethink what this is really about. The genius of Trump is that he is able to pull back at any point and manipulate the opponent without the opponent ever realizing. He has said repeatedly, hashtag steal the vote. That's exactly what he has said for months. Then he made a very clear implication. He said, I will use common sense or my intelligence, i.e., both literal and figurative intelligence. And those of us in the intelligence community, be it who they are, again, what I said in 2016, when we exposed Hillary Clinton, we now exposed, and it was Trump who initiated this, Biden family, Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Jim Biden, Frank, the whole family who was played right into a game where they were convicted and you're seeing what's happening now. What was not announced was that we watermarked all the ballots with what I said, QFS blockchain, which is a very hard encryption code to break. And the second thing is we sent, as I probably 20,000 or more, our national guards 48 hours ago, none of it was reported. And I thank the press for not reporting it and others. So what in fact is happening is you're seeing a sophisticated sting operation that was initiated by Trump. I'm just a lowly peasant in this game. And honestly, I was informed that I could say something about it today only last night. That's why I could not come out. Well, you just a reverse of what you guys have been thinking. It's not a civil war. We have not been surprised in any way. This has been a setup by Trump for a long, long time. In the same way that we knew about Hillary Clinton, I warned about the coup that we would do it counter to. And this is our county to again, against the Bidens. And that's exactly what we expected. The corruption in the mail, the corruption of USPS, we corruption with the Democrats everywhere and anywhere. There was no surprise here. And that's why we deployed national guard soldiers to 12 different states. Steve, you've just broken certainly perhaps the biggest news since the election here on this show are arrests inevitably coming down the road. They're coming not just down the road. They're being implemented. What you saw Corey Wendowski and beyond the same when they were in Clay County and as well in Philadelphia, that was not just a threat. That was exactly what's going to happen. People will be arrested as of tonight, tomorrow, and it will go on for quite a while. And this was a total sting operation that I can say. So explain anybody else. Well, as I have the permission to say it, I do not deal with classified information. As you know, I do not work for our government, but because I'm loyal to the Republic and I work with a lot of people who are loyal to this Republic, including the 16 intelligence services, the Secret Service, our civilian service, they've all been great. And they've kept it quiet. And I've been given the permission to say what I just said. I have nothing more to say, but this is not a surprise here. This is the biggest sting operation probably in our country that we've ever had. So how is this watermark on the ballots? What is the significance of that as to is it going to stop from fake balance being counted or how is that going to be used? Well, we use it in any way that we need to use it in terms of counting, knowing which ones were fake, which ones were not. It's a very sophisticated code. So if you just throw them away, these are cyber communication implementations that we have the code for. We know exactly what was thrown away. We know exactly what was placed. We know exactly who has it, and we know exactly where it went. I can't go any further than that."}

And then in the cold of mystery, he just watched his eyes see. He said, lady, there's a dark man coming to your house with a bundle. So I went home to wait and see what that present was. All of a sudden I see my old man hang a stagger on down the street, so chuck full of gin he could hardly work with his load. Then I knew what that fortune teller meant when he said, there's a dark man coming with a bundle. He's a-singin', the song's softly singin', the song is a mighty heavy package for the thunder.

I'm Josh Bernstein filling in for Gary Francie and the next news network. Now before I get started remember folks next news is being heavily censored. My channel, many other channels, so make sure you're still getting your subs, you're still subscribed, you're getting your notifications, make sure that you are still getting everything that you need in order to find the show. A lot of people are saying that they're not getting the notifications, people are saying that they've had to resubscribe two, three, four times even. So they're doing it to my channel, they're doing it here, they're doing it all over the place. This is how they're trying to silence us. Even taking a status suggested video. So please make sure double, triple, quadruple check, make sure you get new notifications, make sure you're still subscribed and if you're new to the channel, check out the newsletter in the description below. Now let's get to your story. According to Evie Fordham from the Daily Caller, Daniel Cameron, a black Republican running for the Kentucky Attorney General, fired back on Wednesday after being told to quote, stop eating the Coon Flakes that the White House is serving end quote by a local radio host and attorney. His tweet reads, yesterday a liberal attorney said that I should stop eating Coon Flakes in a at-corial journal interview. I am a proud lifelong Republican, part of the diverse at-Kentucky GOP ticket and yes, I support at real Donald Trump. It's time to stop telling black Americans what we are allowed to believe end quote. Attorney Dawn Elliott has already received blowback for her remarks. Cameron, who is 33 years old, is running against a 67 year old Democrat named Greg Stumbo. Stumbo has stumbled at the annual fancy farm gathering on Saturday, a political event where both candidates for Attorney General spoke. After comparing Cameron to a child, something perceived as a racist trope, Stumbo's team quickly walked back the accusations that the quote, children line was racially charged. Look, we need more black Republicans. I've said this many times and I'll say it again, 40 and 25. If the Republicans can garner 40% of the Hispanic vote and 25% of the African American vote, black vote in America, Democrats can't win. Democrats cannot win elections. Now, one more thing, this Dawn Elliott character, well, I think she ought to hear from all of us. So look her up, Dawn Elliott in Kentucky and what I would do is I would contact the radio station that she's on and tell them that you want her removed. She is a racist and she should be removed. You know what? They do it to us. Why not we do it to them for once, right? Go after her advertisers. Do what they do to Laura Ingram and do what they do to Tucker Carlson and everybody else. Let's give them a little payback. Those are my thoughts. What are yours? Put them down in the comments below. Give us a like, give us a share. Continue to watch the Next News Network.

{"vid": "non_hate_video_197", "transcript": "Off the cuff and short for time with Waptec here. I'm gonna do this vid as best I can. Here we go! Someone asks, when it's cold out and you're doing back-to-back videos, do you like to use Coleman propane stove, folding sternosed stove, or to eat your hot chocolate piece? Love and happiness. None. I used to do alcohol stoves and I used to make them for people. And I even made little kits because at the time you could get a beef stew can that was exactly the right size to cook. A meal pattern, as we called it, it's a set of meals that you do very efficiently and not waste any water. And it would warm me up and it would be really good and it would make sure that you did not produce carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide excessively in a tent. I don't do that anymore. Heat damages tents because they're mostly made out of polyester and whatever. Number one, number two, I eat before I go up. That way I don't have to relieve myself when I'm in the woods. Not having to do, you know, taking care of the little bits and pieces of my life. Is much easier. I just make sure I don't have anything to expel. Now why am I bringing this up? The multiple things for maintenance when you are homeless are the same as when you're a prepper. And even military people reference this. If you do not have to do something that puts you in a compromising condition, you're better off. When you have to live in a tent or you're homeless, the last thing on earth you want to deal with is your digestive system or bladder doing something inconvenient. Being horribly sick recently brought this up because it doesn't matter what I did. I was going to be sick. Wherever it would happen. It's the most debilitating and defeating thing you can go through to have your body basically turn on you because it has no choice. It's trying to get rid of a disease or infection. And it takes away your ability to even stand up. And it becomes a problem because now if it's really really cold, you know something that will conduct heat away from you and you're now dehydrated and get the idea. And that's the next step. Not having to do anything when I'm not sick make sure I don't get sick. I still clean myself. Obviously you have to or you're gonna get sick. I have to take care of the bits and pieces while I'm dealing with this. So it's a very good idea to reduce the number of times a week or a day. I have to do anything or at least make it to where I can time it. I can almost time my life by it. As the joke goes in the military you should be able to set your watch by it. So next on a video I did of the 1974 non-human paracaris skull in mitochondria DNA test, collective evolution, ancient origins, and Facebook BS talking about it. Someone posted a comment on this. I'm gonna bring up a couple of things, but here we go. No, that was not actually something that would work and yes the analysis was done to sell books and and and TV show you know visits and that sort of thing. Next someone says most of our DNA is exactly the same as the banana. No, it's not. Is that effort real or is it BS? No, most of the DNA chains can be found as duplicated in other creatures. You would expect that DNA sequences aren't literally totally unique within a short duration and some protein sequences are duplicated. Humans don't produce vitamin C. Other life forms do. We lost the ability to do that at one point. Changed out for being bald I guess. But anyway, look how many species have gone extinct. Why wouldn't a species of human be under the same threat? True. The other thing is I have to point out we chimpanzees and bonobos are probably related to some common ancestor for a weird reason. We have one fewer chromosomes than let's say, or chromosome pairs, then let's say a chimpanzee and one of our chromosomes has an end piece that looks like the ends of the chimpanzees one, but it's stuck together. Now this is something that isn't just a coincidence. It does indicate that we're freaks. We're mutation and that kind of mutation happens all the time with a virus or or even gamma rays hit DNA chains. Reduces the number of chromosomes.

Oh, I just want to say it's Fine, I just want to say when I first heard you a long time ago I used to think to myself I said man this guy is easy to cool He's awkward Tom, but as I started to listen to you more. I started to see how much since you made Amazing and what have you realized from the sense that I make? Basically, I realized that Right now I'm in a fallen state and the reason why I'm calling is because I'm Asking for advice. I haven't I haven't seen my father in four years and I've been angry with him for over 20 years And I just want to know how to Go up go about forgiving him as you've been talking about and why have you been angry at him for 20 years? What did he do to you? well, basically We just ever since I was a child. We never had a good relationship. We are Often he would often go overboard with any type of discipline or anything like that and I Harvard resentment that he favored my my younger brothers more than he did me So that's why I had always had that anger at me and what an you made an example of him going overboard with discipline I Well, basically a lot of times he would tell me that I was a sorry excuse for a son or that out of all his sons that I discussed in him, so You know stuff like that that would just make me angry. Are you the oldest? Yes, and are you the closest to your mother? Well, we had yes That's why he felt that way you identify with your mother and he probably saw you as being a weak boy because you're acting like your mother and he judged you because he you acted like the woman that he hated and Go to him find him and let him know I'm sorry for resenting you for that I understand now you asking that your mother you identify that doesn't make it right for what he did to you in the way He treated you but he hated your mother because he married to his mother his mother Your mother is his mother Because men marry women that like their mothers because they resent their mothers and then when they get with them They become like little boys and if they can't get past the mother They become violent or they start to cheat or they leave or all of the above So you identify with your mother. That's why he did that to you All right Make sense and then just let him know I Didn't understand why you treat me so badly. I now understand It wasn't right the way you treat me, but I'm wrong for holding it against you. I realize you can help yourself Okay, I'll basically I'll go ahead and do that I just have to basically make my way down to Virginia so that I can do that Yeah, I don't argue with him if he agrees fine if he doesn't find If he explains to you explain to you what happened, that'll be good But forgive him Lord in your whole life will change you come back to yourself and there's nothing like being you You're gonna have a perfect peace within All right, thank you very much Jesse.

Organizing in the deep South is not only dangerous, but in Mississippi poverty is not just a word. It is something that we feel deeply. And when you're trying to organize poor people asking them to spend their last $5 on personal fundraising is not an option. And I know because some months the last $5 of my paychecks go to national directly. So, we had Confederates and white nationalists show up to our reading groups, not meetings, reading groups with guns and threaten our lives. Because we are forced to choose public meeting spaces due to financial restraints. And past the hat would make sure that no other small chapter has to deal with that. No other small chapter has to spend their last $3 when they live paycheck to day on paycheck. Like just trying to get like resources. We're not like asking that we don't have to pay dues.

{"vid": "non_hate_video_227", "transcript": "Well, here we go again. First, I remember a long time ago, it feels like now, when we were still talking about, you know, lockdowns and all that. I first covered the case of Amad Arbari, who was a black supposed jogger, you know, just going for a jog in the neighborhood that was gunned down by some virulent clansmen. Or so the official narrative went in the time and it was funny how that whole thing unfolded. And then we got the George Floyd thing, which, you know, unlike the Amad Arbari thing, had a pretty universal agreement of people saying, you know, hey, what, he was using a $20 counterfeit bill. He might not have even known it was counterfeit. And then he ends up dead. Neon is neck for three minutes after he's passed out. You know, everybody pretty much agreed at the time that, hey, bad situation. Then we get all these riots and things. And then, you know, the media is telling us that, oh, well, the riots aren't a part of the peaceful protest. You have to separate them, which, you know, was nonsense. They would never do that for any right wing group. If there was any violence, there was one person, you know, who even said a mean word at a journalist. The whole protest would be condemned as violent by the press. But here we have rioters, you know, not only shouting mean things at CNN, but actually beating up CNN employees and even going to CNN headquarters in Atlanta and trying to burn it down before being, you know, stopped by the police. And then eventually it felt like this week, or last week, it felt like, you know, things were starting to calm down, that there wasn't as much violence going on and that there was just more. It was more of the aftermath, people still talking about, you know, how cops are bad and stuff. Oh, and then we had the chas, the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone wasn't that fun. And so I felt like we were moving on. And then all of a sudden, on Friday night, all hell breaks loose when, you know, an Atlantic cop kills some black-eyed Wendy's. And apparently this was some guy who was drunk going through the drive-thru and passed out while he was waiting for his food. And so the, you know, the Wendy's called the cops to wake him up and get him out of there. And of course they made him, you know, they had him take a breathalyzer, which from what I understand, the smart thing to do is if a cop offers you a breathalyzer, you want to turn it down and just go to the station and get arrested, which sounds counterintuitive, but what you've heard is like the better legal thing to do, because maybe then they do a full toxicology report and there's like margin, there's a margin of error. There's more error when it comes to the breathalyzer, I think, so if you're on the edge, you know, it might register you as over the legal limit when you're not. But this guy apparently had a, was like 10 times the legal limit, so he was not really on the margin, so probably wouldn't have helped him just to decide to get arrested and not take the breathalyzer. But either way, it was very clear his goal was to not get arrested, because once he took the breathalyzer, it was clear that he was, you know, heavily intoxicated, although, I mean, he seemed not, probably not okay to drive, but he wasn't, you know, he wasn't falling all over himself drunk when he was talking on the body cam footage. But, you know, what ended up happening was the cops decided, okay, you're drunk, so we have to arrest you for DUI, because you were in the driver's seat of your car, you were driving through the Wendy's drive-thru, so you're getting a DUI and the guy resisted and grabbed the taser and ran off, and that's when things become a little murky, because we don't have the best video, at least, that I haven't seen yet. We have one video where they run off screen and you can't see them, and then you hear the gunshots, and then there's, you know, another one, which captures the full scene from the Wendy's surveillance, and in that one, I mean, it looks to me, actually, in the other, in the first video, it looked to me like the cop at first did not pull out his gun, he pulled out, you know, his own taser, because I think the Richard Brooks was his name, grabbed the taser from the other officer, because I see the officer chasing him, and he's like, oh, no, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. So, you know, the police are chasing Brooks, pull out something that looks yellow, and, you know, it fires what looks like, you know, the darts with the wires attached to it that the police tasers have, the kind that sort of, you know, hook into your skin and then they zap you. Well, my guess is he must have missed Brooks, because, you know, Brooks keeps running, and then he turns around and points the taser at the cops, at least that's what it looks like. We can't see exactly, but, you know, that's what the police are saying, and the video seems to confirm, at least, something like that happened. And then the cop pulls out his gun and shoots him. Now, in ordinary times, when there's not a lot of tension over this sort of thing, you know, this probably might generate some angst amongst locals, but this wouldn't be a national story. I mean, you have a guy who had a DUI resisting arrest, and then stole a taser and tried to, you know, use it on the cops, and he got shot and, oops, he died at the hospital. But with all this going on, you had to know that, you know, the first response to all this is that, you know, people are going to immediately think that this is totally unjustified in every way. I mean, I'm looking at the video, do I really think that it was a, you know, a great idea to shoot the guy? Well, you know, it's hard, because I think of it from the perspective of an ordinary American, and I know that as an ordinary American who's not a police officer, you know, I would get charged for murder unless I shoot someone who's actively, you know, attacking me. If someone's in retreat and they're running away from me, and I shoot them in the back, then I'm going to jail. And now, police, from, you know, I understand, are not trained that way, because they're trained to, you know, to hunt people down. The job of a cop is to arrest, you know, people who are suspected criminals. And so, you know, can I say that, you know, in principle, given what his job description is, that he did anything wrong, no, I just think that he did something that was, you know, very dumb in our current context. I mean, if I were a cop right now, I would not be, you know, I would look at, every time I pull out my gun, that I'm sticking my neck out there, and that I am, you know, the one under threat, unless I'm being, you know, directly attacked by somebody. But if you're a cop and you're using your gun in an offensive way, you are going to be in a pretty, you know, pretty bad predicament. You're going to be held to a very high standard. A standard, dare I say it, almost as high as an ordinary American. So if I were in this guy's position, I'd look at it as, oh, okay, got in the Wendy's parking lot, had a DUI, he's running away. I'm not going to shoot him because I don't want to put my, you know, put my livelihood at risk. That's the way I would look at it. Now you might say, oh, well, he had the police taser, you know, he's a threat, he's running away, he's drunk, he could go out and hurt somebody. That may be the case, but if I'm in that cop's shoes, I'm not taking the risk. My advice to all cops out there is just do everything you can not to shoot someone. I understand, you know, this guy already fired his taser, and so the tasers are kind of one-shot deals. If you mess with the taser, I believe the training is, you know, you switch to the gun because that's your last resort to try and subdue a suspect. But if it's a situation like this where it's, you know, something like DUI, which is a real crime, I don't think that DUI should be legalized or something like that. This isn't, you know, this isn't something as BS as, you know, peddling a counterfeit $20 bill. You know, driving well, you know, 10 times over the legal limit, you know, with blood alcohol content is dangerous, you know, because you can kill somebody on the road. There's other drivers on the road. I'm not saying that DUI is okay. But when you're under so much scrutiny, I just don't see the point in trying to hunt down every last perp. Cops right now, really, the best thing they can do is the bare minimum that they have to do. The less cops are noticed right now, the better off that they will be. Because in every one of these situations, the mob is going to side with whoever gets killed because they're already whipped up into that frenzy of, you know, the police is just killing innocent people. So when the cops kill somebody like this, you know, they're going to give, you know, the suspect the benefit of the doubt. Much in the same way that, you know, a lot of people would tend to, you know, would tend to believe that suspects who get caught up in, you know, bad times with the police had it coming. The attitude right now with a lot of folks is that, you know, the police are the ones who are always up to no good and they kind of have it coming. So, you know, what did, what sort of rioting did we get last night in response to all this? Well, they burned down the Wendy's for no apparent reason. All day they were not letting people go to the Wendy's. If anyone tried to pull in the parking lot, they were, you know, blocked by the mob, shouted down, and, you know, they hurled, you know, epithets at them telling them, you know, hey, go get a burger at a black-owned business, which if you're driving down the road and you're just looking for some fast food, I don't know which one is owned by a black person or not. I mean, for all I know, that Wendy's could have been owned by a black franchisee. But the protesters, I guess, since they, they're maybe too afraid to directly attack the police and go burn down the police precinct, like what happened in Minneapolis, they just decided to blame everything on Wendy's because Wendy's happened to be where this guy got killed. And the police, of course, did not protect the Wendy's. The Wendy's was burned to the ground. Now, CNN, I have to give them some credit, was trying to document this, and the rioters, you know, beat up CNN and smashed their camera. They do not like CNN, but CNN still called them, you know, protesters and said, well, you know, the protesters didn't like us filming their protest, you know, it's, I did, oh my God, it's just, it's completely unbearable. So even, you know, I mean, how much more cucked can you be that, you know, when your own guys are getting beat up by these rioters, you still refuse to call them out and call them rioters, you still are carrying water for these people who detest you on the most basic level. They hate you just as much, if not more, than the average Fox News viewer. And then, in addition to burning down the Wendy's, they decided to shut down I-75, which I'm sure is quite scary because if you're going through there and you happen to be, you know, in the line of cars that get stopped, what happens a lot of time is the mob will come up and just start smashing all the cars on the highway. That's their way of protesting, is they jump in front of these people, make them stop, and then they smash their cars in Graffiti and things. Now, I haven't seen any evidence of this happening in this case, but, you know, that's my first thought. If I'm one of those cars that get stopped, you know, you're scared to death, you managed to be of kids in the car. Because this has happened in other cities, when they shut down the highways, they go and just, you know, beat on cars and things. It's frightening. Of course, if you don't have a lot of money and your car gets totaled by a mob, you know, you're kind of screwed. But this isn't how the mob thinks. The mob wants to say that, you know, everybody's responsible for, you know, the actions of individual police officers or whatever. I mean, the comments on Twitter, of course, are absolutely disgusting when you see this kind of violence. People are going and it's like, well, are you saying that a Wendy's is more valuable than black lives? It's like, shut up. I have no patients left for these people. As Hans Hoppe said, crush the anti-fascist mob. That's how I feel. The more I look at this stuff. At first, you know, because remember, I'm one of these people who's, you know, rather critical of the police state and of, you know, government tyranny and all these things. But, you know, these people are deranged. And don't twist that into meaning a racial thing. I've been very clear from the beginning that I think that this is a whole left-wing movement. I mean, let's just look at the chas. I mean, do you think that there's too many black people in the chas? But of course, with Atlanta, you're going to get a lot more black people. But, you know, this is not something that has to do with skin color. And neither, frankly, does the policing thing. I've explained, you know, so many times, you know, why I just detest the racialist argument about crime and about policing. And I've explained the statistics, you know, because there's this thing called multivariate analysis. You might not have heard of it. But just because, you know, there is a correlation between two things doesn't mean that there's a direct causation. Just because the number of black people killed by cops, as a percentage of their population is higher than whites, even though the absolute number is still much lower, that does not mean that cops are, you know, just going out and looking to kill black people because they're black. There are other variables you have to control for, you know, like poverty and, you know, whether they live in high crime areas or not. And, of course, poverty tends to determine whether or not you live in a high crime area. If you're LeBron James, you're not going to live in a high crime area and you're probably not going to have too many terrible interactions with the police. But, you know, it's just these arguments have been made so many times, time and time again, that if you haven't gotten through to people at this point, you're not going to get through to them. They believe what they want to believe. And they're going to blame who they want to blame. And, you know, they're not even just blaming the police, they're blaming all white people. And demanding that I and other people who don't have enough melanin in our skin bow down to those who do have enough melanin. Now, I don't know exactly where the line is. You know, you look at guys like Barack Obama, he's pretty pale for a supposedly black man. You know, what's the rule? Is having one black grandparent maybe make you a black person? We could use the same rule as the Nazis used for the Jews. Or are we going to use the one drop rule from the old south to where if you had one drop of black blood, well, then you're a black person. You know, the racial theorists on the left, I don't think have thought this out so much. Now, I guess a lot of the right-wing racists have and they probably have their own rules, but, you know, I don't read them because they're not relevant. Despite what the writers might tell us and what their apologists on Twitter might say, you know, these phantom white supremacists just aren't anywhere. I've never met any of them. Right-wing racism is about the most, you know, the most marginalized idea in America. Left-wing racism, on the other hand, is exalted and in fact those who do not endorse left-wing racism and practice it openly are condemned themselves as evil racists. It's quite ironic. So I suspect that the killing of this Richard Brooks character is going to reinvigorate things. You know, I do feel bad for him and his family. I don't think that he should have died. I mean, obviously the man was intoxicated so he wasn't making the best decisions. He was very drunk. And, you know, I would like to think that there was a way that, you know, they could have gone about things that did not result in his death. But either way at this point, you know, there's much bigger issues on the table than just his death. It's, you know, the cohesion and the collapse of our society.

I was not expecting to see this guy's face in the news because I actually know him or more so knew him. If you don't know about this, I suggest you go back and watch that video. But I'm here to tell you why he's a fraud and this is bullshit. First off, he claims that Antifa attacked him because he went to a protest not choosing sides instead being in the center. And that's not the case at all. During the first Trump election, he was actually very forberny until Hillary got chosen as the Democratic leader. But in the middle of that, something changed and it wasn't his Antifa attack because that was within the last two years. He's been an extremely right wing ever since then. He's started to fight on Facebook and even problems with people in public. Secondly, he says he got attacked. He's actually a very, very well trained kickboxer, in fact at a national and professional level. How do I know this? Because I'm a kickboxer as well. In fact, this is me and him in 2013 getting ready to weigh in for the WK national tournament. He's been fighting me more because his coach, Chris Train, at Weapons 9 in New Jersey, actually kicked him out. Lastly, there's this Twitter post that shows him right after he beat up protesters bragging about it. Directly before going to the cops and claiming that he was the victim. I can't believe people are making excuses for him. If you're not sure who that guy in the clown makeup is, that's Paul Miller. Okay, if you're not sure of the backstory, please go back and check this guy's profile. He's talking about this gypsy crusader here, this guy Paul Miller. Now, as you can see, he's sitting here next to my son. We know this guy because he was an established Muay Thai fighter and kickboxer. His instructor being a very well-known Asian American instructor. Hearing about this guy being very well-known as a racist and this gypsy crusader who stands against Black Lives Matter and people who look like me. And then knowing all that we've done for this young man makes me happy to know that his instructor kicked him out of the gym not once, not twice, but three times. And it makes me sick to hear and see so many people standing up for this dude."}

We don't play that fucking non-inclusive shit. We don't play that, we don't play that whole shit. This is America, dude. And in America, all right, corporations can fucking, you know, let fucking Harry, Harry heroin fucking make your heroin disappear, disappear Houdini. You can fucking shoot up in the bathroom, dude. Bottom line. Okay, doesn't matter what you and I think. But here's the thing, dude, is Harry comfortable? He has his pants off. He might have done some extra recycling, copped a little fucking little small bag of a little bit of the old, little bit of the Yale to mix it in there. Right? He's having a good one. Comes in, orders a fucking latte, extra whipped, extra ice, dude. Goes in the bathroom, knows he's gonna be in there for a minute, dude. Let me tell you something. Monclery shot heroin till he fucking died, dude. That motherfucker was always hogging up the bathroom. These motherfuckers obviously don't have heroin. Heroin heads in their family. Nobody else will use the shitter. You know, not necessarily that there's fucking needles everywhere. They're just gonna be in there and nod it out, dude. Got their fucking head just chilling on the shitter. Getting a good nod in, dude. You know what I'm saying? Before they fucking start their day, they're just sipping their latte, watching a little fucking, you know what I mean? Probably watching some MSNBC, some CNN to see what else they're giving out for free to heroin fucking heads today. You know what I'm saying? That's all. I guess my point is this. Listen, if you're gonna have it, you gotta have a time limit, dude. I mean, we can't do anything. What about everybody else that needs to take a shit? I need to take a grimy shit in Starbucks, dude. I don't shoot heroin. What about me? What about us? You know what I mean? Uncle Dust for president. Teamfuckers and Luskies, dude. Let's get some tuna. Let's get the fuck out of here, dude."}
{"vid": "non_hate_video_248", "transcript": "He is one of the most outspoken critics of police use of force here in the valley, but he gets some on-the-job training about use of force tonight. Very interesting stuff. Reverend Jarrett Moppen led protests and marches after Phoenix police shot and killed an unarmed man. Well tonight, he gets a chance to experience the split second decisions that police have to make when encountering a suspect. And our Troy Hayden was right along with him tonight getting the training as well. This must have been eye-opening. It was. It was a really interesting experience. We've all watched those protests all over the country after police officers were accused of shooting people who weren't armed. But what would happen if one of those protesters felt what it was like to wear a badge and then be put in a life-or-death situation himself? So I'm going to have you put the holster on right inside your belt loop there. Jarrett Moppen gets his weapon. You might recognize him as a high-profile organizer in the minority community. Just last month, he led marches on Phoenix police headquarters after an officer shot an unarmed man. We want his badge. We want his gun. We want his job. Today, he accepted an invitation to look at things from the other side, agreeing to go through a force-on-force training session with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. Three scenarios where you have to decide to shoot or not shoot. Scenario one is a call about a man casing cars in a parking lot. Moppen approaches the man and starts asking questions. You're looking for your vehicle. What kind of car do you drive? What kind of car do you drive? It's my car, man. Moppen, the officer, is shot. It happens that fast. At what time did you think that it was time for you to address the use of force that was given? When he came to the back of the vehicle and was hiding, I could sense something was wrong. Scenario two, a call of two men fighting. What's going on today, gentlemen? What's going on today, gentlemen? What's happening here? What's wrong with you? What are you doing, man? Hey, he should have approached me. He should have approached me. What's happening there? What are you doing? You just shot him? Hey, he rushed me. Tell me why you shot. Well, I shot because he was within that zone. I felt there was an imminent threat. I didn't necessarily see him armed, but he came clearly to do some harm to the officer, to my person. It's hard to make that call. It shakes you up. Again, an unarmed man was shot. Scenario three, a call about a possible burglar walking down the street. Moppin gets him on the ground. He's not complying. I need you to keep your hands up, sir. For what? Because I need to check that waistband. Well, what? What are you doing? Because I don't know what you have under there. Everybody, look at this guy. What are you doing? No shots fired, but the suspect did have a hidden knife in his waistband. I went through the scenarios, too, without seeing what Moppin did. Do you have keys or do you have anything to show me that? No, I need to talk to you. Come on out over here. Well, I'm dead. Here are a couple of county sheriffs. Get on the ground. Get on the ground. Both of you, get on the ground. Get on the ground. For what? Get back. Get back. Same results for both of us. Things happened very fast out here. I asked Moppin what his biggest takeaway from this exercise will be. I didn't understand how important compliance was, but after going through this, yeah, my attitude has changed. This is all unfolding in 10 to 15 seconds. People need to comply with the orders of law enforcement officers for their own sake. Thanks to the America County Sheriff's Office for taking us through that today. It was an eye-opener. That's a tremendous admission that Reverend Moppin just made. Right. You need to comply for your own safety. Right. And he saw it. I mean, he plainly shot a man who was not armed but was coming at him and he felt, you know, that he was unsafe at that point. He was coming after him and he fired. Yeah, and I don't think any officer goes into work thinking, I mean, he shouldn't kill somebody today. No. But these interesting, you know, things happen. Like, the guy coming from behind the SUV, boom, and you're done. And you are. Six shots of that. How did you feel about those scenarios when you were going through them? How did it change your perspective? Yeah, it just, I've been through one of these before about four or five years ago, but it just reinforced how fast things happen. And you think at the time, oh, I can think through this and I can figure this all out. No, it's, boom, it's just there. It's that fast. I have a lot of respect for Moppin for going through that. Yeah, I agree. And agreeing to go through that and seeing it from the other side as well. Do you think it changes the way he approaches these issues going forward? He says he's going to go out into the community and say what he said at the very end there. You have to comply with what police officers tell you. Let everything sort out at the end, but just do what they tell you right then and sort things out afterwards. Interesting. Alright, thanks Troy. Good stuff, Troy. Thank you."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_256", "transcript": "So if someone watches episode one through to the end, what do you want them to learn as they're sat there on their sofa? I think one of the things is that, you know, survival is in gender specific, actually. You know, women might approach stuff differently to men, but really it's about this. It's about heart and character. I'm all about being independent, not, you know, relying on men for anything. But fire is really important and the way that they have their camp set up, they have an area to put wood to keep dry. They have all the things they need to cook food. They keep their fire going because it's right by their bed. I mean, they just have a really good system going for them and we don't. You forget to see the differences. And be quite careful not to make it sort of a battle of the sexes and let people draw their own conclusions. It sucks that we need the boys for some things. Yeah. Unfortunately, there's things that we really need from them and I hate that it's always like a bargain. Well, what can we get from you? And it's just so annoying. I don't know what their mentality is. Every time they ask for something, they act like they deserve it and they make it sound like we are taking more from them than they are from us, which is completely ludicrous. So every time we turn around, they're warning something. In a quid pro quo situation, someone in a position of power demands sexual favors in exchange for job benefits. You just want just a minute of warmth and then you can just struggle through it. And when the boys said that they didn't want us around standing around their fire anymore. Unless sexual favors are given, there'll be a loss of job benefits. We had so many people writing in saying you've got to do a women's version and I thought alleluia, brilliant. This is what we really want to do. We've been crapped on since we've been here. We got zero sleep last night. We stayed up the entire night, froze, soaking wet and we haven't had to fire because it rained and put it out. So now we haven't eaten. It's about heart and character and determination. And that's not just a domain of a woman or a man. This is a very high fall. Make sure you keep your arms to your chest and land on your back. Here we go. Bill Johnson, Jonas Johnson. Go Nina. Come Zelisha. Go Johnson. You're on lead right now. Go, go, go. Go Nina. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Well done,�도rrenc & Wilkie Courtney with a serious injury holding that wrist. Come on. Courtney are you okay? I'm really busy. I don't think I can be on phone. All right, everybody hold up. Okay, so it's unclear right now what it is for sure until you X-ray, you won't know. Yeah. Which means we're not sure her status in the game at this point. why don't you take her out of here. All right, men, no tribal council tonight. Grab your stuff, head back to camp. Women, I'll see you tonight at tribal. Yeah, yes. It was like heartbreak. Those guys don't give a crap about any of us girls, and it showed it today. They don't care. Yeah, yes. Woo! F***! We're not letting those muscles discourage us at all. All right, let's load up the stuff, guys. Girls, if we all just keep our head in the game and try to stay together and just take the boys down, then we'll just be one huge ball of bad-assness. 2,000 years later. This season's Battle of the Sexes hasn't been a battle at all. The Men's Tribe has won every challenge. Go, go, go, go, go! Yeah! Bad-assness. Words are words, but actions are actions. F***! Image or clothes or makeup, whatever our sort of stuff is. You know, it's not what we are. You know, what we are is beyond all of that. Chelsea and I needed to wash our hair with fresh water so we can look shiny and clean. What people look like, it matters. You know, there's like lots of studies that have been done on that, so we thought if we put fresh water in our hair, our chances go up, up, up. F***! F***! F***! The reality is, if you're real masculine, a number of women today are offended by that. Just the bare presence of pure, unadulterated manliness infuriates some women today. When they're on a charm, then... Go get away with it. I said what I said. If you don't understand the logic, or if you don't agree with the logic, go ahead and do what I'm saying. No, no, no, I'm just trying to make sure I heard you correctly. Does it matter the order? Damn it. Shut up for a minute. I'm not in a good mood. Just shut up. Relax, man. Can you not do that right there? No, you can relax on it. It'll be okay. We started working on our shelter, and lo and behold, as always, some of the girls came over and were like, can we borrow an amber from our fire? They didn't have fire. I don't think any of the girls want to stand over there. It's uncomfortable mooching off of them. I mean, they're all like, excuse me, move, move. I literally just wanted somebody to punch me so I can be knocked down by them. Talking about where we haven't been warm all night, blah, blah, blah, we're soaking wet, we're cold, we're freezing. So the guys have just, I guess, had to get this mindset like, no more deals, it's off. Like, you know, this is a game, we want to be nice, but again, we're playing for a million bucks. Like, screw these girls. I went out grab hunting this morning and came back and found saturated the girls in our shelter underneath our stuff, sitting on our beds, you know, soaking wet, you know, sitting by our fire. I need to borrow your car right quick. What kind of shit is that? Most people want to borrow a sugar, even ketchup. You want to borrow my car? Hell no. The worst thing in the world to me is being wet and cold, and it's been like that for a long time. Crying is a waste of water. F***! Everyone's different, you know, I mean, the women gets really quite feral and shocking, actually, in a way that I'd never anticipated. Put this back in the sea, shall we? Put this back in the sea? Erica starts throwing away some of the group's firewood. She's lost her mind. You put this back in the sea. It's just... It's a... What is going on? She's now going to push some wood in the sea. No! No! Oh, my God, I am so f***ing sorry! F***! One of the women on the island, which was... Because I can't afford to cry anymore, was dehydrating me. I feel such a dick. You're my hero. Oh, thank you. When they're tired and they're beaten up, they just crumble. You know, I haven't determined how this can't do it. We are a team here, aren't we? Apart from Jane. You know what? We're dealing with hormonal, irrational women right now. It's not even worth trying to negotiate, and at this point, I'm done. Every time we caught a fish, it was like a big hurrah. Like, you know, we know we can do something that the boys have been doing every day. Stab a crocodile, gut it, and then carry it out of the jungle. With the glass ceiling broken, all the oppressed groups shall prosper. So, me and Troy go over to the women's tribe, and we propose that they let us use the net, because they obviously don't know how to use the net. So, they go over. Me and Troy go over and we say, listen, if you let us use the net, we'll give you 50% of whatever we catch. I'm just like 50 fish. That's enough. Everybody can have two, three fish each in both tribes. So, Jonas doesn't have a suave way about asking things. What we want to do now, we're not pushing the issue. What we're going to do is just let them fumble around for a few more days and not catch fish, and they'll come back, and when they come back, the deal's different. It's not 50-50 anymore, because they're coming back to us. The deal's more like... What do you mean, is that all? What the hell, you want a hand job? I want to fuck you up the ass. You can stick it up your own asshole! I would if I could. Bitch. Every day, our number one priority is shelter, and we're so overworking on our shelter, and it's still just, it's not... We got to get to the bottom of it. We got to get to the bottom of it. We got to get to the bottom of it. We got to the top of it, and it's still just... It's not... We got rained on all night last night. It's like every time we go to bed, we dread it, because we know we're just going to be sitting there miserable, soaking wet and cold until the sun comes up. The girls came back over today. They were absolutely freezing. I mean, I couldn't stop thinking about them last night, because I just knew that they were absolutely freezing to death, and then they come over in the morning, and they're absolutely frozen to death. And it just, it pisses me off, and I just... It's just not right. And that was just, I mean, outright wrong. You just shouldn't do that, because I want to help them as much as I can, because that's what is being a man. That's what is being a gentleman. That's what is being chivalrous. Why the hell would you ever align with a bunch of girls? But I think that's kind of a man thing to do, where we're really kind of thinking it through, systematically, what we have to do, like the army or something."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_264", "transcript": "Brian and Jen, Yukon Police say after investigating the incident surrounding that video, two male students are now facing charges. But the NAACP chapter here at Yukon says it's still on high alert. This video has gone viral, but for all the wrong reasons. It shows three men walking through the parking lot of the charter oak apartments yelling the N word. Yukon Police announcing tonight the arrest of two male students as a result. 21 year old Jared Caroll and 21 year old Ryan Mukash both scheduled to appear in Rockville Superior Court next Wednesday. Police say a third male scene in the video did not participate. Yukon's NAACP chapter says they won't stand for such behavior. The chapter held a town hall on campus Monday night focusing on a list of demands they want to see from the university. We want to see more diversity amongst the faculty. We want to see the university answer incidents of racism with more promptness. Although arrests have been made, students say if the university does not take further action, their silence will create a culture in which racism is tolerated. It's good because it's an example for everyone on the Yukon campus that there are repercussions for your actions and that actions need to be taken in order to show that there's change being made. Next town hall, just one of many measures students are taking after the video surfaced. Just hours before, hundreds rallied on campus, marching to oppose racism in all forms. New Yukon President Thomas Catzeleis taking the bullhorn. If you're not for equality and respect, then I'm not for you. I didn't think it was going to happen so fast and I think that the gathering today did help. I don't think there was a sense of urgency before. I also would just like to see more care from the whole entire student body. And President Catzeleis releasing a statement just a short time ago saying it is supportive of our core values to pursue accountability through due process for an assault on our community that has caused considerable harm. I'm grateful for the university's collective effort in responding to this incident, especially the hard work of the Yukon Police Department, which has been investigating the case since it was reported.

Now we want to pick your brain a little bit as we admire your huge trophy by the way. That's ridiculous. But I'm going to ask you first. We'll start with you, Amina. What was the topic first of all? The topic was restricting presidential war powers authority. They say the niggas always already queered. That's exactly the point. It means that the impact is that that is an impact turn to the afraid that that it is the case turned to the affirmative because we we are saying that queer bodies are not able to survive. That necessarily means that the body of the niggas is not able to survive. We got the topic in about July when we started doing our research then. Now when the niggas sees these seeds as a brick that he can only envision himself that he does not see another nigger that he can feel sympathy for or embrace but rather that that otherness gets obliterated. We've been supplementing our research throughout the season. So where do you go from there? You know when you start preparing for a national competition once you know the topic what's next? Well you do a lot of research. The way the statistical works is through whiteness allowing forcing other bodies to tell a mirage of whiteness and the violence is the whiteness of me. In order to prepare for it because there are several different tournaments until being able to transition, to reach to kind of a... The white world is cultural. The white world is such a child eye zone. And able to respond to opponents' arguments. On sexual trauma as a way of browning as a racist cultural fantasy the cultural traffic in India is a black man's authentic object. So just a lot of pressuring shame. This figure lynching trauma enough. The inside the trauma representation is a big issue. To the black child, to the violent, to the violent, to the stories and to the white girls. Reading of articles and books. They only recreate what it means to be an authentic nigga because we are not allowed to read certain things or speak in a certain way because we are seeing this not as naturally speaking. Truly speaking to niggas but as a question of who even wrote this shit. All that good stuff. Is there anything that threw you off during the competition?

{"vid": "non_hate_video_282", "transcript": "Alrighty, we are going to learn how to put a MailChimp subscription signup form on your WordPress blog. They have a widget that you can add to your blog. They have a plugin that you can use to create this widget, and we're going to show you what to do. First of all, you need to create an account with MailChimp, which is an autoresponder service. You can set one up for free to start with. I've created a list called Matt's List. Once you log in, you go up here and click Create a List. Create a list again. The first thing you need to do is name the list. You put the email address that you're going to be sending email addresses from. That's going to be the from email address that people will see when they receive your newsletter. If they respond to it, they will respond to your email address. So decide what that email address is. In case people have questions, they might want to respond. It's good to have a working email that you look at for that. There's a little reminder for people to remind them that they really did subscribe to your newsletter from your website. So you put a little reminder there about that. You put your address. You have to put a physical address that's part of the Can Spam Act, which is required when you send out bulk emails to people. Then you can get notifications daily summary one by one when people subscribe. That can be kind of fun at first, but after a while it gets old. If you're getting a lot of subscribers, sometimes it's just fine to get a daily summary. Then you click Save and you've created your list. We have already done that here. I have Matt's list. Now what I want to do is I want to let people give people opportunity to subscribe from my list to my list on my WordPress blog. I want to put a little subscription form on there. I'll show you what I mean. Here's one of my blogs that I'm just in the process of setting up. This is what a subscription form looks like using the Mailchip plugin on your WordPress blog. I have a WordPress blog and I very quickly created a simple form. This is what we're going to do. People when they come to my blog or to your blog, they can come here and decide to receive newsletter updates from you. This is how they subscribe directly from your website. This is the form that we're going to put on. I just want to show you what it looks like. We're now back here in the Mailchip login. You've created a list. We've gone through that. Now we click on this little arrow and we're going to go to sign up forms. Now there's a number of different ways to do it. For these purposes, we are going to use their WordPress plugin. They talk about that down here. Learn more. We're going to use the WordPress list subscribe form for WordPress. The first thing you need to do is to log into the back office of your WordPress blog. I'm here at the dashboard. We're going to add a plugin to the WordPress blog. A special plugin that allows you to add a subscription form. We're going to come here to plugins. Then we're going to come to add new. Plugins add new. Here we are in the plugin section of your WordPress dashboard. We're in the add plugin section. We're going to go to search plugins. We're going to search for the exact name of the plugin. The exact name of the plugin is Mailchip WordPress list subscribe form. In the search box, you put Mailchip WordPress list subscribe form. Now what we're going to do is we're going to click search. I just clicked enter on my keyboard. Here I have found Mailchip list subscribe form. I copied and pasted or typed in Mailchip WordPress list subscribe form in the add plugins area. I clicked the enter key on my keyboard. That's the same thing as search. I get this plugin Mailchip list subscribe form. I'm going to install this plugin into WordPress. Yes, I'm sure I want to install the plugin. Now for on my setup, I have to put the FTP login information for my website. It may be different for your setup. But here I have to put in my login information. That's what I'm going to do. This is my FTP login information. Now I've successfully installed it. Now I need to activate it. There we go. I have activated the Mailchip form plugin. Now you will see it is here. List of plugins has active. Now I click on settings. Here you just put some basic information. Here I have my website that I'm just beginning to build is about software. So join our list to get free marketing software. I put free marketing software. You can get more creative than this. I even misspelled this. I did it very quickly. You can get creative. The good idea is to give people an incentive to join your list. Join our list to get free tips about whatever your subject is. Get a free course. Get our latest updates. The idea of this is to keep in touch with people who are interested in what you're writing about on your blog. You can fool around with this. I'm going to update subscribe form settings. Now you can play with all of them. This one is important. What fields do you want to require? You have to require an email address. That's the whole point of this. It's up to you whether you want to require a last name. Just a note. The more fields you ask people to fill in, the less subscribers you will get. I generally go with first name email address because it is nice to personalize the emails. You can put a tag that says first name. Their first name will appear. It's more personal. You get better open rates when emails are personalized. Other people just go for email address only. You will get more subscribers but you will not be able to personalize the email. I do not go for last name. I think that's enough. That's just me. Now we want to go back to the dashboard of our WordPress setup and go to appearance. We go to appearance and we're going to go to widgets. We click on widgets. This may vary according to the theme you're using on your WordPress blog. I'm just using 2011. It's a very basic theme. Here is the WordPress widget. All you have to do is drag and drop this widget where you want the sign up form to appear. I want it to appear up here. On my sidebar, I put it here. Save. Close. Let's look at my blog. Wow. There is my sign up form. When people fill in their email address and name and click get free software, you can say anything you want. Get free tips. That's up to you to be creative. Try to give them an incentive to join the list. Here is my subscription form. I'm using a different strategy. Here is a bullet point. Get $6,000 free software. I'm going towards my audience. You'll figure out what's good for your audience. The bottom line is you have a subscription form on your website, on your blog. Now people can subscribe to your newsletter. You just add a plugin and drag and drop the widget over to where you want the form to show up. That's basically it. You can play with it. Let me know if you have any questions. It could vary a little bit according to your setup. It's relatively simple. You can have a nice form on your blog. You can follow up with a visitor on your newsletter. As far as I'm concerned, it's the number one marketing method there is. Thanks a lot."}

It walked right off the back of the boat and onto my barbecue grill last night which is right underneath my kitchen window and it was shaking its booty at me. It is literally taunting me at this point. I mean look at me I'm a mess I haven't even shaved. This thing is literally taking over my life right now. It's all I can think about. So we've got to get this thing caught. Be sure to smash that subscribe button and hit the notification bell because I will be uploading all the videos that have to do with this boat going forward. We are going to be covering how the insurance company handles this situation because I do have full coverage on the boat and of course we will be uploading videos on the entire rebuild process so you're going to want to see that. Which leads me to a question for you guys. Do you think I should change the name of this channel to Mile High DIY? Originally I had wanted to do camping vlogs but the channel has just kind of swung the direction of DIY and project videos. So let me know what you think. Should I do two separate channels or just continue doing this channel as it is just change the name to Mile High DIY. Let me know. Really curious what you guys think. Alright let's go try to catch the stinkin raccoon. Okay guys tonight's setup. We've got one trap here with the sardines and a marshmallow. It's right next to my grill and I've thrown out a couple pieces of marshmallow and actually a couple pieces of hamburger meat and I threw it out on the cover hoping to bring it this direction and then still got the oil and even some syrup on the ground now and that goes out to the second trap that I've got set and this has the marshmallow maple syrup medley. So hopefully this will be good enough. We do have the backup plan if necessary but hopefully we get them today. As you can see we got them. We went for the sweets."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_305", "transcript": "Yesterday, Manitoba set a single-day record of new COVID-19 cases, with Dr. Brent Rusen hinting at more restrictions to flatten the curve. And as Manitoba looks into an uncertain few next few weeks, we're turning now to one of our province's former Chief Public Health Officers for his insights into the virus and how to handle it. Joining me now is Dr. Joel Kettner, now an associate professor at the University of Manitoba's College of Medicine. Good morning to you, Dr. Kettner. Good morning. So as mentioned, you served as Manitoba's Chief Medical Officer of Health from 1999 to 2012. During your tenure, you dealt with concerns about viral outbreaks, but really not on this level. That's true. In fact, you could say we had a pandemic every year with influenza. It meets the criteria for a pandemic. But right now, we're using this term in quite a different way. And even the pandemic of 2009, H1N1 influenza, or other similar kinds of challenges that got our attention like SARS and at one point Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which are both coronaviruses, there's never been really a response to a respiratory virus like we're seeing now around the world and in Manitoba. I mean, sometimes we talk about the virus causing all of these problems, but we have to also think of the response to the virus, which is causing quite a bit of issues too. So I just want to put in a couple of quick caveats. I'm not criticizing government decisions or our public health leaders. They have a lot more information about what's going on than I do. So I have to be respectful and humble about that. And I'm also not recommending that people should reject or not follow the directives or advice. But I do have questions about the policies and the attempts that are being used, not just in Manitoba but elsewhere, to try to interrupt the spread of this virus or control its impacts. So what are some of your questions and concerns, Dr. Kettner? Obviously, we've had restrictions. We've had lockdowns in the past and we could be facing more restrictions going forward. So what are kind of your main concerns? Well, in public health, we have to look at the big picture. And we have to think about not just one disease, but all diseases and injuries and causes of morbidity and mortality. And we have to also think about the impacts of our interventions, the side effects. We call them in medicine, but the harms of interventions. And I think we're learning more about what those harms are and how they're maybe unfairly distributed and affecting people differently based on single parents, people working for hourly wages, small enterprises which are closing, big effect on the economy and our deficit of government, impacts on education. I mean, we're learning more and more about what those harmful impacts are. So what's the benefit? Well, the benefit is, as we know, to try to flatten the curve. In other words, to try to prevent our hospitals being overrun with cases and to try to reduce the mortality, especially premature mortality. How much benefit do these lockdowns and restrictions have? No doubt they have some impact. But we have to put this in perspective. So here's a few numbers which I think your listeners might find interesting and important. 4,500 cases in Manitoba, that represents less than 0.3% of our population. One in 300 people so far have had a positive test result. 58 deaths, that's one per 25,000 Manitobans. One in 25,000 Manitobans have died. That's less than 1% of all deaths. In other words, less than 1% of all causes of death. ICU admissions, 15, that's about 20% of our ICU beds. In a typical flu season, the majority of ICU beds are taken up by people with a variety of viral and bacterial causes of acute lung injury or pneumonia. And we so far from estimates, from descriptions of our capacity for ventilators, we're using up less than 1% of our ventilator capacity. So Dr. Kettner, what are you... I want to add one more point. Hospitalizations, 83 hospitalizations, that's less than 3% of all our beds. So we just have to put into perspective the impact that this disease is having. And on the one hand, and of course, one other very important point about this disease, it's primarily affecting older people. 80% of our deaths in Canada are in people over the age of 85 and in residents of personal care homes. Okay, Dr. Kettner, I'm so sorry."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_310", "transcript": "Here's Baltimore City schools dealt with a teacher attrition problem. In the last three years alone, more than 2,500 have voluntarily left. WMAR2 News investigative reporter Skylar Henry sat down with leaders in the school system trying to figure out why it's been happening at such a rapid rate. They were painting it to look like a map. Baltimore City schools has a problem. School CEO Dr. Sonia Zandalises won't deny it and she's trying to get ahead of it. It's a mass exodus of teachers. Is that interruption of having a new teacher every year? The official term is teacher churn negatively impacts some of our most vulnerable students. And families know that. The numbers at first glance are staggering. Hundreds of teachers are leaving annually, voluntarily. Zandalises says it's a trend that predates when she arrived and she's right. One of what we have to ask ourselves is where are teachers most vulnerable and which teachers are leaving. Some of the attrition is good attrition, right? Some of the attrition is if you are in a profession, you think you want to be a teacher, you realize it's not for you. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Zandalises' arrival in 2016 marked at the time the second highest number of teachers leaving the district in the last 10 years. One year in and the numbers went from 815 teachers leaving to 902 teachers calling it quits. The challenge Zandalises says is finding out why so many teachers are leaving and what she can do to stop it. That it's usually not one thing. It's usually a combination of things. And we have incredibly dedicated teachers who work in less than ideal physical circumstances but because of the colleagues they work with, because of the professional satisfaction they're receiving, the physical conditions aren't as large as a factor even though they would love for them to change. Those physical circumstances have been the last straw in some cases. Other teachers claim it's the pay and a few touched on being put in challenging schools without proper resources. One thing it is not, most teachers we spoke to said, was the students. We've always for generations had ails in our community. There was drugs, alcohol, crime, back from great grandparents. You know, we've had these issues but when you entered that school building that was just a whole other world. You know, in regardless of what was going on in your home, you know when you came to school it was a safe haven. But it's the quality of teachers. Santalisa says she worries that may leave the district. Those who resonate with students and leave a lasting impact for the better. We could do better. We could do better in making sure we're placing our newest teachers not in the most challenging circumstances. And other professions don't do that. In Baltimore, Skyler Henry, WMAR, two news. Dr. Santalisa says there will always be attrition and that the state has a teacher attrition problem. In addition to keeping good teachers around, they're hoping to create supportive professional environments to keep as many teachers as possible."}

A chemist at his best, getting me ripped off with a switch and pump gas again. My lunar senses signal to me a massive threat to the internet from people who want to ban the web. So I go back again to the mad and net because I need to see the reason for the mad, Kev-ech and holy shit. Now what is this? A man against the spread of dune coons into the white land and then I learn he brought his whole armory and camera and he like him himself killing the sanded men. I find the video news even tried to ban the web from possessing to see the kind of mass effect that Mr. Brenton Tarrant could have had on them. They even tried to ban the motherfucking manifesto. Now they fucking wonder why there was a man possessed with so much anger at the state of man to get off his ass, get a gun and take a stand against White Genocide. A real plan that I can attest to. Bagpipes from Christchurch. When will it ever cease? See the stream. It's evil to speak the least. Bagpipes from Christchurch.

Puree's Tarrant could have killed shits for days covered in dust after all the bullets were sprayed. He's a real life shit poster of my own make. The manifesto is worth a read for its own sake. I read the whole thing in 20 with no break. A perfect plot. But when he went to go and take out the enemy he faltered as often as he fired using a little more ammo than was required. Dropping spare magazines as the attack transpired. That execution left a little to be desired. I could sit here and nitpick the guy all day on how he started outside instead of in the hallway. But the point of the attack was to make a doorway for the world's division and for the great long race. Or to begin at last even if fun declared. When they see the moon rise they will all be scared.

{"vid": "non_hate_video_327", "transcript": "Several days before Tuesday's equinox, I started to notice movement in Earth's magnetic field. It suddenly felt like shifting sand under my feet and a wobble in the astral plane. I woke up three nights in a row, being called to protect the stargates with other gatekeepers. There was an unusual amount of activity in the non-physical realm. Then I noticed people posting that their animals were subdued and birds were quiet. Those sensitive to energy were becoming aware of a magnetic shift happening. During the equinox event, I saw a heavy, oppressive magnetic layer unlocked from Earth's aura, opening us to new energy. Magnetic fields operate as buffer zones, compressing particles and creating time lag. When magnetic fields weaken or dissolve, timelines spring open, freeing stuck energy. You may experience rapid release of unlocked trauma, memories and fears. What was blocked or hidden now become visible and accessible. In this manner, our world reality expands with more possibilities. According to SpaceWeather.com, a powerful stream of solar wind, hot plasma, ejected from the Sun and is impacting Earth's magnetic field this week. Unlike solar flares that affect the electrical grid, these solar winds alter the magnetic field. Not only do they shift the magnetics in our personal energy field, but they alter the capacity of the mind. Don't be surprised if you see more folks waking up. In addition to solar wind activity, Mercury turned retrograde in Aries, shaking loose hidden personal agendas and tightly held secrets. Mercury retrograde in Aries highlights issues around what you desire and your ability or a lack thereof to create what you want in life. During this three-week transit, we have the opportunity to explore the core motivation of our desires. Is it ego driven or soul expression? Core issues are emerging as one of the themes of 2018. Mercury retrograde in Aries offers time for review and investigation into core power issues. Who and what is driving your desires and do they empower you or weaken you? The magnetics are opening new timelines to all seeking personal ascension and enlightenment. Next article On Friday, March 31, a full moon rises at 10 degrees Libra, a blue moon, the second full moon of the month. In addition, this full moon is opposite Mercury retrograde and square Mars, creating tension in the planetary field. During this transit, those who are gullible to mind control can be manipulated by blatant lies. Follow your spiritual practice, maintain your inner zero point, soul connection, and empathic discernment. We are witnessing karmic retribution for the misinformation deceivers grabbing power at the expense of the vast majority. The illuminating solar rays are flushing out the hidden dark agenda and reveal all in the light of truth. If it doesn't radiate love, it is not of the light. The wear of propagated lies and conspiracies that plug you into the dark matrix program. If it is not uplifting and opens your heart, it is constricting your energy. The wear of the controlling fear programs and polarizing competition that trigger your primal self. We will be broadcasting a timely podcast discussion on Saturday, March 31 about the recent equinox, magnetic shifts, and the full moon ripple. This is a powerful ascension upgrade that propels us to the next level of living our souls life. If you cannot attend a live broadcast, the replay will be available at the event link.

I don't know if it means anything or not I think it's just probably the lighting.

So here take a look Hello everybody I am in Vermont and I'm driving out to Ohio to hang out with Unirock and Catch a wedding and I see something really odd which I have not seen since does a little kid and that is a daytime moon I'm gonna try to show you it Looks really weird Check this thing out Right there you guys see that Daytime moon, so I'm gonna hold it steadier right there I don't know if that got it or not, but I hope it did There it is the daytime moon check it Wow can't even focus on it I see it right there It's going in and out. Yeah, I won't focus on it very well Feel free to leave a comment below If you thought that was a strange looking moon or if that's just like a lighting effect I don't really know I'm not trying to stir something up, but I thought I'd show it to you guys So you take a look also, you know, I'm on all these alternative networks feel free to hit me up over there and chat me up and Let's not forget I'm trying to get on.

{"vid": "non_hate_video_333", "transcript": "Hi everyone, I'm Mary with Mary Gridley News. Thank you for joining me. Why in the world would MIT make a fake video supposedly showing President Nixon making a speech about the failed Apollo mission? There's a document that's posted online. It's an archive from the government about a speech that President Nixon would give in the event of a disaster and it's dated July 18th, 1969. Fade has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace. These brave men, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin know that there is no hope for the recovery, but they also know that there is hope for mankind in their sacrifice. These two men are laying down their lives in mankind's most noble goal, the search for truth and understanding, but we don't have that these days. They will be mourned and by their families and friends, they will be mourned by their nation, they will be mourned by the people of the world, they will be mourned by Mother Earth that dared sin two of her sons into the unknown. In their exploration, they stirred the people of the world to feel as one in their sacrifice. They bind more tightly the brotherhood of man. In the ancient days, men looked to the stars and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, we do much the same, but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood. Others will follow and surely find their way home. Man's search will not be denied, but these men were the first and they will remain the foremost in our hearts. For every human being who looks at the moon in the nights to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever mankind. And then the paper says, prior to the president's statement, the president should telephone each of the widows to be. After the president's statement, at the point when NASA ends communication with the men, a clergyman should adopt the same procedure as a burial at sea, commending their souls to the deepest of the deep, concluding with the Lord's Prayer. One Twitter post says that lawmakers are already concerned that deep fake videos could threaten national security and interfere in elections. Now MIT explores whether they have the potential to rewrite history. So how much did it cost to make this video a president Nixon making the speech? There's already enough controversy about whether we went to the moon or not. You know, President Nixon never actually gave this Apollo 11 disaster speech, but yeah, it sure raises a lot of questions. Why do it? Are they just showing the potential to fake stuff? Yeah, like I said, all they have to do is shut down the internet, control the internet, which Google is already doing. You don't know if a real war broke out or not. You wouldn't know if there was truly a mass shooting somewhere. You get so much fake news out there. If there was truly a disaster that people should prepare for, they probably wouldn't do it thinking it was fake. When people should be heading to the bunkers, they'll still be out there mowing their lawns. Did they do this as a warning for what's to come or what has already been posted on mainstream BS media like CNN, MSNBC, etc. So what are your thoughts? Put your comments down below.

The sample of lunar soil brought back has a big impact on the Soviet's understanding of lunar geology. The results of the analysis shock Soviet geologists. It looked like something had happened to the soil in an area of the moon that was supposedly undisturbed for billions of years. What could it have been? Test on the sample confirmed that the soil used to be buried deep underground. Some one or something brought it to the surface. The Soviets know that the Americans haven't been to this part of the moon. They think this is their turf. So they have to face up to the question, who the heck's been disturbing the lunar surface here? Could someone else have landed on the moon before the US and Russia? I have heard that the Germans developed a moon rocket before they were defeated in 1945. A fact from NASA's own records, the Germans had a very advanced space exploration program. The Nazis were leaders in the rocketry industry. And they had people like Warnir von Braun. One aerospace engineer, Warnir von Braun, is the founding father of rocket science. Warnir von Braun was a genius. He had been a Nazi, but he was a genius. And was able to design systems that to this day are still astounding to us. During World War II, the Nazi regime asked von Braun to develop the V-2 rocket, the first man-made craft to reach space. NASA and their Russian counterparts both know that this Nazi superweapon was a key step in the development of their own moon rockets. We would not have been able to land on the moon if it hadn't been for the Germans. Damn right. The first American rocket was based on V-2 technology. The first Russian rocket was essentially just a V-2. How difficult is it to believe that the Nazis pushed their technology just that little bit"}

Today the crowds we exploit are even greater. To life farther we must be able to sustain fictions of greater distance and duration. Your minds are the resources we harvest with our machinations. We pretend to overcome radiation, isolation, gravity and extreme environments as we've always done. That's the video game we created to bind the minds of humanity. We're producing another moon hoax, a play by 2024. And this is how. We want to believe we have the ability to get larger, heavier payloads of planets and beyond Earth's gravity. For this we simulate an entirely new rocket, space life system. SLS be the most wasteful rocket ever developed. And without CGI production. And more in Tyscene. This game system makes you think we can fly deep space missions. We fidget lies in capsules for you to believe our game. From wasteful launches to CGI fake space in the good old parachute trick. For this trick we built Orion. This is NASA's next generation human space fiction. Ventific data and maps from lunar orbiters are programmed to create many moon hazards and resources. We currently producing an entirely new hoax to landing and operating on the moon. Funding our commercial partners with your money to make up science instruments and robotic props. You are paying your way for human fictions in 2024. Our task is to hoax quickly and to keep it going, to cash our production efforts with the further that can convince the weak that we return to the moon in a manner that is wholly different than 50 years ago. With our simulated reusable lunar landers we pretend to land anywhere on our CGI lunar surface map. To sustain this fiction we give them a platform in orbit around the moon from which to transition. A canister shaped platform to fake deep space experiments and be a mental dead zone for non-thinking humans. We call this linear pulse gateway. The beauty of the gateway trick is that we say it moves between orbits. Balancing at a will between the Earths and the moon's gravity. With a fiction that is ideal for producing even deeper space missions. In 2009 we learned that the moon contained millions of space believer minds. These minds can be extracted and beautified like water and separated into oxygen for breeding or hygiene for rocket fuel. This new moon hoax is quite uniquely designed to deceive us and propel us to Mars and beyond. I should not believe it. This is where we're tricking more. This is a replicate throughout the solar fiction. This is the next genre for human space exploitation. Humans are the most malleable subjects in this entire production and yet we lie for humanity. We go to the moon and on to Mars to fake knowledge and understand it and to spread lies everywhere. We lie knowing our stories with further new fictions that cannot be foreseen. We lie because we're destined to exploit you and deceive you controlling all minds. We want another moon hoax now a better illusion to serve as reinforcement. As a checkpoint for all the lies we told our fakest adventures still ahead of us. We are faking it. We're hoaxing. We are hoaxing. We are hoaxing. We're hoaxing. We're hoaxing."}

Have you ever gazed upon a full moon and wondered, wondered how it got there, what strange forces could have possibly built it? There are many moons within our solar system, yet few are as strange as ours. No others are known to ring like a bell when struck. No others possess such luminosity as our moon. In the 1970s, Michael Vassan and Alexander Shashurbakov of what was then the Soviet Academy of Sciences created a thesis that the moon is actually the remnants of a very ancient spaceship created by, as yet, unknown civilization. The article was entitled Is the Moon the Creation of Alien Intelligence and was published in Sputnik, the Soviet equivalent of Reader's Digest. The suggestion of a hollow moon first appeared in science fiction when H. G. Wells wrote about a hollow moon in his 1901 book The First Men in the Moon. Michael Vassan and Alexander Shashurbakov's hypothesis is based on the fact that large lunar craters, generally assumed to be formed from massive meteor impacts, are generally too shallow for scars made upon an organic body, and can have flat or even convex bottoms. They propose that small meteors are making cup-shaped depressions in the rocky surface of the moon, while the larger meteors are drilling through a rocky upper layer, hitting an armored hull underneath. Does George Lucas know something we don't? It seems he couldn't resist adding just one crater. The authors referenced earlier speculations by astrophysicist Iosif Shiklovsky, who suggested that the Martian moon Phobos was an artificial satellite and hollow. Interestingly, Phobos has been claimed to appear to be hollow by numerous astronomers, who have stated that it appears to have an opening on one side, making it, in a sense, similar in shape to an empty shell. Phobos' orbit is also a complete mystery. Many who have researched it claimed that it should have crashed into the surface of Mars many moons ago. Between 1972 and 1977, seismometers installed on our moon by the Apollo missions recorded strange moonquakes. The moon was described to have been ringing like a bell during some of those The support of evidence was then brought to popular attention in March 1970, in an article in popular science. When Apollo 12 deliberately crashed the ascent stage of its lunar module into the moon's surface, it was claimed that the moon rang like a bell for an hour, leading to arguments that it must be hollow. Several YouTubers, most notably Crow777, have supposedly recorded what is now known as lunar waves, if confirmed to exist. This may prove there is some form of functioning shield or scanning system being seen working on its surface. The fact that the moon is less dense than the earth is also strong supportive evidence that it is indeed hollow."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_346", "transcript": "Over the years I made several videos regarding so-called astronaut Don Pettit, basically the head of Mockery when it comes to NASA. I find it very interesting what he says during this interview from a few months back. He basically states that technology to go back to the moon has been destroyed. He'd love to go back in a nanosecond, but that technology does not exist anymore. But then he goes on to talk about going to Mars. First off, before even showing this video clip with him speaking about, again, this technology which I find very bizarre saying it's been destroyed. How is it destroyed? He doesn't go into details how this so-called technology that they used to go to the moon years ago has been destroyed. Let's take a look first off, again, when it comes to Mockery in this video clip, basically again mocking his audience, his followers during this presentation. Take a listen to what he says here. That astronauts are really, really good at making pictures in space that look like you've never left the planet. In fact, it's almost hard-pressed to tell whether you're in space or not in this picture. We've got some fancy backdrops, I guess. What a strange person this is. Basically again, if you follow my channel and see my previous videos on this so-called astronaut Don Pettit, of course none of these men have been in space. There's nothing more than basically actors playing a role on the world stage, making the masses the millions upon millions of people throughout the world believe they've been in space when they've never been in space at all. Now I'm going to put the video clip itself with Don Pettit again being interviewed. Just very bizarre interview, not going into details how this so-called technology to go to the moon has been destroyed and at the very end I'll point out something very interesting what he says. People need to read between the lines. Take a listen. We could go to the moon in a nanosecond. The problem is we don't have the technology to do that anymore. We used to, but we destroyed that technology and it's a painful process to build it back again. But going to Mars should be one of the next series of steps that humans do. The first step should be going back to the moon for a number of technical reasons and exploration reasons and then after that Mars, maybe high orbit in Venus atmosphere, maybe going to Europa. There's all kinds of targets to go to places of interest in our solar system. The only limit to a human future is in our own imaginations. With that goofy look on his face he says the only limit to a human future is our own imagination. I find it very interesting. He's not saying it's based on technology, what's feasible based off technology. He says it's based on our imaginations. It comes down to it like I played this video clip I'll show in a second with William Shatner stating science and science fiction are one of the same. There's no difference whatsoever. Take a listen. My question is through your career and your writing and your acting you've inspired so many people to enter the sciences. How do you balance science with science fiction? They're both the same. The mystery of science fiction is what I'm talking about. Science and science fiction are essentially the same. Thank you very much. How do you prove the black hole? How do you know those gravitational waves prove the collision of two black holes? Somehow eventually they are able to observe phenomena. No! They can't observe. It's too far away. It's too theoretical. How do we know what they're saying is true? You know what reading is? It's all science fiction. Science and science fiction are essentially the same. Thank you very much."}

Just let that statement sink in for a moment. And then here's another one. Homosexuality is ugly. In Iran, we don't have homosexuals like in your country, with of course a picture of Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The ads are being posted on buses around San Francisco. Ten of them have gone up. The woman is behind them, Pamela Geller, and her group, American Freedom Defense Initiative Pamela, thank you for being here with us this morning. A lot of controversy about these ads. Tell us why you want them up. What is the point? Well these ads are a response to a deceptive and fallacious ad campaign being run by the Muslim Brotherhood Group Care that says that Jihad is getting to the gym every day. And so our ads were designed to show the reality of Jihad using actual quotes from high profile Prime Minister of Turkey, the Fort Hood Jihadi, the Times Square bomber to increase awareness about the ideology that sanctions the violence and supremacism of Jihad. You're being accused of this being just blatantly anti-Muslim though. What is your reaction to that criticism? Well it's deeply offensive to Muslims because the implication is that all Muslims support Jihad and we know that that's not true. But we don't have to pat on the back every Muslim that doesn't want to kill us. We expect that, you know, that's our bar. So I think that that's a canard. I think it's a deceptive statement. I know from my own email box that many Muslims stand with us because they escaped Jihad wars and they escaped the Sharia. But there have been over 20,000 deadly Islamic attacks since 9-11 and Americans need to understand the ideology that inspires these acts of war. Pamela, I want to bring in Linda Sarsour. She's with the National Network of Arab American Communities. Linda, you've seen these ads. Pamela says she's quoting Muslims including Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. What's your reaction? The ads are absurd. They're offensive. You're quoting a man who is a Holocaust denier. I mean, this is not a, this is not, he's not an American Muslim. And Ms. Geller has a history and track record of vilifying the Muslim American community and pinning communities up against each other, including her most recent homophobic ads, which are very offensive not only to the Muslim American community, but also to the LGBT community here in the United States. This is not the first time that ads have gone up. You'll remember the controversy over similars in New York. Pamela, your organization successfully sued the New York City Transit Agency when it tried to ban those ads. The issue, you know, for First Amendment freedom of speech. So San Francisco's Transit Authority is in the same boat. Listen. So this is, this is again what we see. Ad hominem attacks, libels and defamation against me. They don't condemn the statements in the ads. You have the Turkish saying the mosques are our fortresses, the minarets are our bayonets, and the Muslims are our soldiers. And the quotes that I'm using are actual quotes from the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Sheikh Karadawi calling for the death penalty for homosexuals. My calling attention to this makes me homophobic. No, I, not calling attention to the plight of gaze under the Sharia is killing people. And so of course, attack, attack me, but don't, but, but where is the condemnation of the actual statements that these high profile Muslims are making? We don't hear that at all. I think it's very interesting and it speaks volumes as to the motive behind, uh, the mystic answers. I will say there's been plenty of condemnation of, of Bakmura Medinajad and for statements that he has said about homosexuals and homosexuality. I mean, there's been plenty of statement condemnation of him and others. I mean, there's been prosecution of, of some of the people that you show on these, you know, the Times Square Bomber and the like. So it's not as if, I guess I don't understand your point. My point is the American people are being disarmed by obscuring, uh, the, the true, uh, reality of Jihad. And this is our way of sort of leapfrogging over the media who white washes and sanitizes it and, uh, you know, alerting the American people to what is the greatest national security threat that our nation faces. Linda, can you see how the courts view this as a freedom of speech that it is Pamela's right to, to put up these billboards? I'm not debating her right and her freedom of speech. And that's why we live in the United States of America. But I will say on the, particularly on the homophobic remarks, um, we could take these ads and it could be about any of the Abrahamic faiths, which have similar, if not identical, uh, uh, views on homosexuality. But what I'm troubled by is Ms. Keller's obsession and fascination with Islam and with American Muslims. Um, why is it that none of those remarks are by American Muslims? We have plenty of national organizations, dominant Muslim Americans in this country, uh, who have not publicly, uh, stated any anti-gay. As a matter of fact, the LGBT community is one of our largest allies because both of our communities, both American Muslims and LGBTQs are marginalized and ostracized. And I'm a civil rights activist. I believe that we live in the United States of America and everyone deserves the same rights that I have. And I will never take the rights away from someone if I'm in this country fighting for the rights of my community. So I'm just really troubled and, and I want to question the obsession, um, with Islam and American Muslims. I have to leave it there. But I just, I would, I would like to say Christians and Jews are not killing gay people. So there may be quotes in the Bible, but they're not killing gay people. And my obsession is with life and my obsession is with 9-11 and with Times Square and the bond, the attempted bombing of the Federal Reserve building and the repeated thwarted attacks for Jihad. My obsession is with life and that's why what I'm fighting for, freedom and liberty. All right, we have to leave it there. And individual rights for all. Pamela Geller and Linda Sarsour. Thank you both for spending a little bit of time to explain it to us. Islam as a religion is a lie wrapped with some facts and truths. I want the truth! You can't handle the truth!

We asked you about what were your concerns? I didn't have concerns because I was already convinced but there were concerns that the liberal media has put out portraying Mr. Trump in a light that I know he's not uh the type of person that he was depicted to be so what we were able to do today was allow people to see his heart for themselves and to make up their own minds about him and they they they find out that he's not the person that the media has depicted him to be.

Well I think we'll be addressing them over the coming months and even over the these are deep-seated difficulties that certain communities have and we're going to address them and if certainly if I'm put in a position where I could do something about them which in this case happens to be president we will be working very very closely with everybody and we're going to be solving a lot of problems right now you have black youth if you look at African-American youth where it's 51 and 55 and 57 percent unemployed you have African-American people of different ages where it's double and triple other numbers so we're looking at a lot of different things but this meeting was amazing amazing people we must have had close to a hundred people in the room and I just want to thank you I want to thank both of you and in particular I'll tell you what it's been there's a whole group of people standing behind me you can't see him because we actually didn't think we were going to be having a press conference but we all thought it was such a good meeting we would do that and we have many many endorsements that came out of the meeting. Is black lives matter a real movement? Is black lives matter? Well I don't want to discuss that because you know I felt and I felt it and I felt it black lives are very important white lives are very important and to me all lives are very important very very important. What is your reaction to some of the back classes that you're having? Well I don't think we have backlash I mean I saw love in that room I see love everywhere I go I see tremendous amounts like right now I'm getting on a plane I'm going to Georgia we're going to have a tremendous crowd in Georgia just like we did in Sarasota we had 12,000 people on all-time record by double and we're going to have a tremendous crowd I'm literally leaving right now in fact because the meeting went so much longer and it went longer only because of the love it didn't go longer for other reasons there were unbelievable solutions I think to problems that we will solve that other people won't be able to solve. What were the concerns that were raised? Well I look the concerns are you look at unemployment you look at African-American Katie look at African youth I mean you have 51% unemployment there's tremendous concerns and they have a right to be concerned. Are you going to change your tone? Well you know the tone has taken me to first position in every single poll including state and including national polls the beautiful thing about the meeting is they really didn't ask me to change the tone I think they want to see victory because ultimately it is about we want to win and we want to win together and I will not forget the group of people that I've met with a hundred people I will not forget these people I want to tell you they are really really smart sharp amazing people who love their community who love the country and love their community. I didn't see it I didn't see it. Mr. Trump said that Muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9-11 today he said that never happened and you should stop talking about this. Well you know he didn't say that the other day he was very weak the other day so the other day he said it like well he doesn't know and now I guess he feels a little bit emboldened he must be careful with what he says. What about your what do you think that but we'll see what surfaces. Let's see what surfaces you'll see. I can tell you this I've had hundreds and hundreds of calls and tweets of people that saw it and plenty of people saw it. Ted Cruz said today that you are not going to be the Republican nominee can you react to that. Well he's got to say that I mean he expects to be but I think that I will be leading in every poll and leading by actually very wide margin so I think I will. I'm not tied with him since one of my time. I'm two points ahead see if anybody else I'm two points ahead anybody else that say you're leading with me they say you tell me. Oh I think I'm going to win in Iowa and I think we're going to win in New Hampshire and I think we're going to win just about everywhere we go and every poll is indicating that and having the help of all of you folks I tell you what's been really an honor and I appreciate it. I appreciate it so much thank you very much. We had a wonderful time in the meeting. Thank you. We made a lot of progress it's not the last one. Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump. I'm going to Georgia I'll see you in Georgia. You're going to Georgia. I'm not actually have you made a commitment to give a financial contribution to any of these shirts? No I haven't knew zero. No it's not about that. Zero such an important question zero. Have you personally been surprised during this campaign to hear some people say that you're rhetoric but they find it racist. No but that's the way they say they say it about everybody that's a very commonly used term. Now it is. Oh no I have many endorsements today. Perhaps you could speak to that there. I've had many endorsements today. How many were where? Over a hundred. Over a hundred passes right here. We're at over a hundred. Some committed I don't know the number. Some are and the rest are praying about it. They said we have to go pray about it and then they'll come back and endorse it a future time. It's a very successful meeting. Most very successful. The next two months are crucial for the primaries. You ready to go? You still have the energy? Oh I have a lot of energy. Oh do I have energy? Whoa do I have it? I'm leaving right now for Georgia. Goodbye everybody. Thank you everybody. Thank you. All right thank you. Love you."}
{"vid": "non_hate_video_354", "transcript": "And what did he say specifically to you? Sit down, nigga. Tishon Chambers is a freshman at Ballet High School, a boy scout, a football player, a member of the ROTC, an honor roll student. He was hanging around his teacher's classroom door in December. The teacher told him to sit down. And the teacher says that Tishon used the N-word first. And I just kind of stunned a second. Well, well, then get away from the door. Nigga? And I was just, I repeated the same insult because that's sort of what I've been trained to do. The school district says that is not what they trained English teacher Paul Dawson to do. He tried to say I said it and for some and I didn't say it. Dawson says that students use the slang version of the N-word at Ballet High School all the time. He says N-I-G-G-E-R is a racial slur, but says that students use N-I-G-G-A as often as they'd say do or hey man. And Dawson says as much as he does not like the word, he still used the slang version to feel more comfortable with black students. Why is this word used so frequently? So I just don't understand it. And I'm trying to understand it. I need help. Yes, I use Nigga. I've used it. I admit it. I put the H on it to emphasize it's Nigga. Nigga, nigga, nigga this, nigga, nigga please. Nigga, can you lend a nigga a pencil? What kind of example are you sending for your students if you use a word that you don't want them to use? Upon reflection, that's not good. Dawson was suspended for 10 days without pay from January 9th to January 23rd, and he has to go to diversity training. He says that he's learned from this experience in hopes that others think twice before using the N-word. I will never say any form of nigga. You know, I'm cured of that. And what did he say specifically to you? He said sit down nigga. Riley Freeman is a third grade student at J. Edgar Hoover Elementary School. He's a basketball player, an avid reader, and one day hopes to spread his philosophy through rap music. He was in class when he had a verbal exchange with his teacher, Joe Petto. But Mr. Petto said it was Riley who used the N-word first. He told him to take his seat and here comes this barrage of insults. I mean, some of the words I've never even heard before and I was just stunned and I said, well, sit down nigga. I just repeated the insult back to him because that's what I've been trained to do. That is not what he's been trained to do. He said I used the word before, but I didn't, I wouldn't use that word ever. That word hurts people. Mr. Petto claims the version of nigga ending in gr is the racial slur, but that he was using a different version of the word ending in guh. That means the same as buddy or best pal. He insists that he was using the friendly version of the N-word to better relate to Riley. I used the word, I admit it. I thought there was a difference between nigga and nigga. I thought I understood this whole thing, but I guess I don't. I need help. Whenever I hear the rappers, they say, nigga. It's in all the music. Look, look, look. Rap songs that use the word nigga in a positive way. There's tons of them. Look, real nigga roll call. Niggas bleed. Chicka mon nigga. Niggas for life. Real niggas don't die. Shame on a nigga. Suck a nigga. Ain't no nigga. I don't understand is that if it's so offensive to them, then why do they say it over and over again? So Riley said the N-word before you did that morning. He says it every morning. He calls me nigga. He calls the other kids nigga. He calls himself nigga all the time. Nigga this, nigga that. Nigga please. Bitch nigga, nigga, have you lost your mind? Nigga, check that hoe. Nigga, you bullshit. And break yourself, nigga. He says it so much, I don't even notice it anymore. Last week in lunch, Riley says to a classmate, can a nigga borrow a french fry? And my first thought wasn't, oh my god, he said the word, the N-word. It was now how is a nigga gonna borrow a fry? Nigga, is you gonna give it back? I tell you, my inside voice didn't talk like that before he."}
{"vid": "non_hate_video_355", "transcript": "Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to extend our gratitude to the musicians and the dance company for your wonderful performance. This has been a wonderful evening. And not only for the music and the dancing, it has also been about us, the people gathered here. English people in the very heart of England. There are no people I would rather be among. No place I would rather be and no time I would rather be alive. Because ever since the terrible events of October when the money markets betrayed us all, I have known that the change is coming. The human species has never faced such immense possibilities, such choices. In the lives of great nations, there are moments of destiny which have swept aside small men of convention and discovered men of the moment. And our host is such a man. For him, the little calculations of little men mean nothing. Here's a man well suited to the mighty mood that England is now in. The only reason I say this now, at this moment, on this stage, is because I have some news. Good news, I think. I'm sure our host will forgive me if I use this platform, this gathering of friends and like minds, to give you, his trusted allies, an early announcement of a long overdue event. I want to tell you, good folk first, that with the dawn of a new decade, I will be setting a new course. Setting up a new political movement here in the very heart of England. And Mr Shelby will be with me shoulder to shoulder. It will offer a new conception of politics in which the great character of the British, our true character, will be reborn. Many of you lost fortunes in the recent stock market crash. The men of money, the capitalists in New York, the Jews, the money power, they run an international system in which the infinite mobility of money, its capacity to create financial chaos and panic, can bring down any government that dares for one moment to oppose it. Four generations, the efforts of hard working men like you, have equipped our competitors against us. The cotton mills of India, the cotton mills of Asia, created with British money but used for the destruction of Lancashire and Yorkshire. The users of New York, the sweated labour of the Orient, combining to destroy the iron and steel factories of Warwickshire and Staffordshire. These are policies that could not be pursued by British statesmen unless they were made or the servants of Jewish finance. They are the ones who took your money. But it is I and those who know this truth, who will light a flame the atheists cannot extinguish. The lengths of our heroes of the great war have been portrayed, again and again by politicians. But hear this, those of you who fought the due war for nothing, you brave men, you will join hands with the angry youth of Birmingham and New York. You will join Manchester and London and Liverpool and declare that England lives tonight and marches on. I say all this to you now because I believe it is in places like this with people like you that we will have to pass on our message directly. Our message can be summarised with these words, Britain first. And because this is our message, I doubt it will be reported fairly in the press. I am afraid the newspapers of this country are owned by the same vested interests who took your money. They sell to the people false news to raise the interests of the faction and the section above the interests of the nation. So hear my words and pass them on to those with ears to hear and be reminded that when the new decade begins, there will be the birth of a new political party which will speak for you. This party, this new movement, this revolution will be called the British Union fascists. Who's that?"}
{"vid": "non_hate_video_356", "transcript": "Hey people, this is a story of how I learned to cure my coon dog from COVID. And so a coon dog is a dog that'll he'll run up a coon up the wrong tree. And the wrong tree is a tree that that coon doesn't have a hole in so he can't hide. And so these dogs is trained to run out in the woods and tree a coon and sound off. And then the hunter will come and shoot that coon down and it make coon skin hats and and if you ever eat a coon you'll know the real reason why they like the coon. It's like the best roast beef you ever had. And so it's been going on for a long time and uh and most of the coon hunters you know they they weren't real highly educated. So um 30 years ago I was living in an old river, Shannie. And a girl across the river brought me this big beautiful black puppy. He looked to be like a black lab but we knew the parents and it was actually a Rhodesian ridgeback and coyote mix. And I had spent a lot of time with that dog training it. I wasn't a coon hunter but uh I was teaching him party tricks and it was the most obedient dog. Everybody in town knew that dog anywhere I went the kids would run up and they all knew his name. I didn't know how but everybody knew my dog. And so he was back dog nine months to a year and he had hacked and coughed a couple times during training. So I brought it to the vet. He was a really good dog and he went through all this check up and she was just loving him and uh took some blood and she came back in later and and she held my hand and told me that my dog had heart worms. And I said how much is this gonna cost? So she went to explain in the life cycle of heart worms to me. And she explained how that the heart worms live in deer out in the field and they draw blood out of that deer and it'll have these microfilli heart worms little tiny little tiny ones that'll fit up in that syringe. And it and it'll bring them and when it went and stuck it in your dog sometimes it lets some of that blood back out and those little microfilli come out. And then they go through a life cycle of growing inside your dog. And so they they breed and so you have many different sizes you know you have the tiny babies and you have them growing you have them growing until they're five four or five foot long. They'll attach there in the heart like a hook worm and you know the heart will pump that blood and they'll hang back you know the heart pumps that blood to the lungs first. So that's why they start hacking they get a little cough. And then you know that worm gets so long it's old and starts to break off you know and after that blood goes to the lungs and it pumps through the brain and it goes back through the cycle and and they dissolve and and come out in the feces. And it's a really ugly sight the way she explains it to you. And I says yeah but you know what's it going to cost me to cure this. And and she squeezed my hand and she said two thousand dollars. And uh I was living here on the river shanty so I kind of shook her hand loose and I told her that me and my dog just aren't that attached. She had let me know that you know they were only in that first second stage they were small still and the price even goes up the bigger they get. So I went back home and went went uh next door to the bait shop. If you don't know the bait shop is it's it's like a bar room on a river except sometimes they can sell you some worms might even have some hooks or sinkers there. And I was telling the old girl that uh operates the the bait shop that about it and she says you know my boyfriend uh he he takes care of his co-dogs he knows something about that. So I was back at my place later on that day and this guy come by he looked about like this except a little meaner and uglier. He looked real country and uh she apparently had told him and he called me to talk to me about it. And so he told me he says you know we ain't got a whole lot of money you know country boys and that we don't have a whole lot of cash we'll take care of our own dogs. He says I'm gonna tell you how how we do it it's the same way that the veterinarians do it. He says uh go to the co-op and ask them for some cattle worm or this Iva mech injection. I don't I don't think they had all the others back then anyway. So get you a bottle of Iva mech and they'll get you some syringes that go with it. And he says get you some seven in one shot while you're there parvo and get him a couple hundred pound warmer pills and go through the regular routine you know you give them a seven one and give them a week and and give them a hundred pound worth of warmer pills however much your dog weighs they'll uh they might if your dog weighs seven it might give you a 50 in a 20 and uh and you just go through uh you know give it to them and give them a couple weeks and then and then do it again. And what you're doing is you just you're you're killing you you're killing the big ones and the small ones you know they breed in that time you miss them during the breeding whether in a egg cycle you miss them so you let them grow up big enough but before that they have time to breed again and kill them again and that's why you you wait that certain amount of time between them. And he says the the trick is you don't want to kill all these worms because that heart when they die that heart's going to pump them to the lungs and then they're going to go straight to the brain and they're going to give that dog a stroke and kill it. He says the trick is to just kill the smallest ones first. He said give them a little bitty dose and you're killing the small ones first and go through time take your time and to so just a few you know just some of them die off slowly and they don't all go into the brain all at one time. He says weigh up your dog and however much your dog weighs the injection is going to be that many milliliters and so luckily my dog weighed a hundred pounds and it made this really easy but you'll have to do a little more math if your dog's different if your dog's bigger smaller. He says start with a dime just 10 percent. He says don't for a couple days don't feed your dog any fatty foods and you know if it's hot outbreak inside where it's cool you know don't stress your dog and give them a dime so my dog's first dose was just at this 10 here and so this old syringe got a needle on it because you're going to have to draw it out a little rubber top on the bottle but you don't inject it into the dog you just unscrew the end and just feed it to them in the mouth and it must taste good because you know the dogs hate to take medicine they know what's up but after I would give it to him he would come back and try to lick the syringe and get it all out so it must taste good and just keep your eye on your dog and make sure he's doing all right you know if something should happen then you have to rush to the vet and tell him what you did and then you know just give them 10 days 10 days 14 days and uh and you just you know you killed the smallest ones the big ones that little dose didn't affect them and so uh 14 later 14 days later 10 14 days later you double that dose up you know so then I brought it to 20 and do the same thing you know for a couple days before that don't feed them a lot of real fatty foods make sure they're they're cool not out in the heat stressing and uh if your dog didn't lay down and get real sick the first time you know a lot of times if they got bad heart worms they'll get sick the first time if it didn't lay down and get real sick the first time you're probably going to be all right just go on out throughout the process you know and and raise it up to to a 20 then in the second week so it was it was uh you know the the first week I give them a warmer peel I give them 10 days and then I give them a warmer peel and you're trying to kill all the little smaller parasites before you go attack this big problem and give it a week and and give them a 7 and 1 injection and then 7 and 1 injection you know it's going to inject in under the skin and uh and then give them 10 days weeks and give them give them a booster if you haven't never given them a 71 before you'll have to do a booster on it but um I've always given my dogs her 71 and their warmer pills always did that myself and so there's no need for the booster so um I give it 10 days and I give them the 10% and uh it barely hit him you know he didn't he didn't really lay down a lot he didn't make them real sick so I knew I was okay like I said she told me it was all it was at the lowest degree they weren't real big and so 10 14 later days later I raised it up to a 20 in the same process 10 14 days later I raised it up to a 40 same process 10 14 days later I raised it up to a 80 same process and then 10 days later I give them the full dose at the 100 and then um you know after that if if you have bad mosquito problem you could just give them this full dose you know their full dose my 100 pound dog took it to the 100 million and you could just do that every month and if you don't have uh the the mosquitoes you know year around you can just wait till the mosquitoes is there or you can you can wait uh two months you know and give them a half dose one month and then a full dose two eggs later you know you can skip a couple months and give them a half dose or you can wait a year when the mosquitoes come back around and start at the dime the 20 and go through the routine but this is uh this is your your heart warmer you know you don't have to give them a heart warmer you really don't this kills everything you don't have to give them any of the other shots any this kills every worm every parasite in them the reason you're wanting kill all these worms in your cattle is so they eat and get fat you know you don't want them wasting the food you don't want hook worms in your puppy you know you feed your puppies forever and they never get any weight because the hook worms is eating all the nutrition they ain't getting no nutrition on their food so coon hunting ain't the same as it used to be uh now they have shows where they don't shoot the coon and uh they just rate the dogs and and the winner gets all kind of cash and prizes uh and i've heard 25 000 and up sometimes so about 15 years ago i was building a barn for local veterinarian and i went by his office in a gallon jar up on the counter with the dogs hard and it was just full of of of four or five foot long heart worms and i knew that was my chance to get the girl to talk you know because uh and they're hypocritical they can't say anything about it and so i told her the story of how i treated my dog when he had heart worms and i told her the whole story exactly how i did it and all she could say was that should have worked you know it's the same when you go down to java mech they're not going to tell you that that's what it's for they can't tell you that it's it's illegal form it's the same reason that uh they take movies down and so uh i posted the movie the other day about this dr cori he was uh two days ago he was in the senate hearing and he told all about all the studies and how this iva mech is the miracle treatment for covid and that movie lasted less than 20 minutes they pulled it down but i put it up here on my hidden history on a bit shoot you can see the movie here and i'll leave the link underneath here so my dog had lived another 13 years after that he was loved by all uh i'd treated uh many other people's dogs that i knew was it was too poor to to treat their dogs for heart worms and i never had a problem i haven't lost the dog yet i still do it today and coon hunting has changed since like i said they don't even shoot the coon much anymore uh now you got a lot of doctors and lawyers running coon dogs for prestige you know just to say they won so i'm going to investigate further into this and see if i can find a human dosage but i would bet it's the same as the dog a million for a for a pound all right i'm gonna cut this off here a good day"}

No, that's not a misstatement because we're going to be talking about the latest technological advancements of deep learning, artificial intelligence, and of course the topic of deep fakes, which me and Jason have been talking about for a very long time, but we're getting yet another glimpse into it as a new startup company used Joe Rogan's podcast to create a voice duplicate which people are saying sounds startlingly accurate. We're going to play a little bit of that clip, but this is interesting Jason. There's a lot to talk about here. I have some personal appearances with people in my life having deep fakes used against them, but this is something that's not going to go away, is going to be a major problem and I believe only going to get worse from here. Yeah, and this audio isn't really, I mean this audio is new, but the audio technology, not really. Adobe has demoed this now for over a year and I use Adobe tools all the time and basically the more it's able to ingest the better accuracy you're going to get of fake audio, I would say when we listen to this, it's good, it's not great. At the same time, if it was a small snippet or it was added with some background noise or another person, I think it would become more and more legitimate. There are a few small breaks in here, but overall it is stunningly accurate. Yeah, I mean if we had this clip played to us normally without any context, I would be like, yeah, whatever, that's the Joe Rogan podcast. We listened to that. And again, this is from a startup. All right, so this is a company going public with this. You can only imagine we're going to get into all that later. We're going to get into Running Man. We're going to get into all that, but this is by a company called DASA. It's an AI company, artificial intelligence company, staffed by former employees at Google, IBM, and Microsoft, all major corporations with ties to the government. So you could only imagine what the government is doing, but let's play a little bit. Let's play like 30 seconds of this latest clip. I thought it was funny. At least the people at DASA have a little bit of a sense of humor here. Friends, I've got something new to tell all of you. I've decided to sponsor a hockey team made up entirely of chimps. I'm tired of people telling me that chimps are not capable of kicking human ass in sports. Chimps are just superior athletes. And these chimps have been working out hard. The throwing kettlebells, battle ropes, everything. I've got them on a strict diet of bone broth and elk meat. You can just stop right there. You can see how it's broken up a little bit. It doesn't quite flow like a human conversation, but obviously they've also chosen some pretty ridiculous subject matter to kind of push their point forward that, hey, we're going to be able to make people say whatever we want them to, and it's going to sound almost exactly if not exactly like them. Yeah later, it's a whole audio clip. It's obviously not endorsing a chimpanzee hockey team. I thought that was pretty funny. Then he goes off later videos often and talks about some tongue twisters and then talks about how everything could be a simulation and how this could be a simulation because of the artificial intelligence deepfakes that shows us how we could just simulate our own voices and videos. Why if technology is becoming so advanced where we can simulate other kind of video, audio, life forms, why can't we simulate everything which sparks a whole other debate that could be engaged here? Jason, this is technological advancements that are progressing, are getting bigger. This is why it's important to talk about this. This is not old news. This is news that's developing. Soon all of this information, all of this technology is going to be let out of the cage for anyone and everyone to use. There's going to be a lot of effects of that. What I really would consider here is if this is a startup going public with this, what's private at the central intelligence agency? What technological advancements do they have that we don't even know about that could be used for sinister purposes like espoused during the fictional movie Running Man that you were just talking about before we get on this program? And the possibility here is stunning when you actually look at the bigger moves made by the CIA, the actual actions committed by them, and now imagine this technology empowered by them. Holy cow, it literally plays out of scenes from Running Man that you described before. Yeah, you know, Running Man, for those that don't remember, this is a movie that was based on a Stephen King novel. All the way back when Stephen King was going by Richard Bachman. He was not the Stephen King we know today. He had a bunch of books under a pen name. And it begins with Schwarzenegger being in a helicopter and being ordered to basically kill civilians when they were out there for a food drop. Now he doesn't want to do it. He gets into a fight with a couple of the other officers. However, when they release video, now this isn't even the real time stuff that gets in later, when they release video, all of a sudden Schwarzenegger is the bad guy that wants to kill civilians and they send him to prison. Now he ends up, you know, breaking out of prison afterwards, but remember they use this initial deep fake against him. You could see something like that now with Jordan Peele making a fake news PSA about Obama. So that's a pre-made deep fake. But later in the movie, which I think is absolutely incredible, first of all, great satire on reality TV culture, bloodthirstiness. Supposedly if you get out of there Luke, you go to a nice island and you get a million dollars and Geraldo Rivera plays one of the people that actually you see on the island waving. Later you find out he didn't make it also a deep fake. Jesse Ventura happens to be one of these gladiator types that's out. He's in retirement. He's the greatest. He's killed all these criminals. You know, he's in the executive room. So at one point, Schwarzenegger gets away, but they've got to propagate that they're number one. They can't let people know that they don't know where this guy is, right? So they bring Jesse Ventura out into a cage battle and they broadcast him fighting with Schwarzenegger, murdering Schwarzenegger by throwing him through spikes. And then as it goes off air, you realize it was all a deep fake as the computer graphics come off the television screen and he just killed somebody else. It was not Schwarzenegger and it was a real time fake. So you know, this stuff has been espoused now Luke for 30, 40 years in movie science fiction to a stark detail. And when you look at real time fakes, because you know, the one with Obama was not, you can look at face to face and they've done a lot of these demos where they use figures like Daniel Craig, Vladimir Putin or George Bush and side to side use a camera again to grab their facial recognition and do a deep fake. Yeah, I mean, if you're a millennial or if you've never seen Running Man, go see Running Man, excellent film. Running Man lets you think about a lot of the things that are happening in our current modern day society, but they could match the two because obviously when we're talking about the deep fake with Obama, Jordan Peele had to do the voiceover. Now this learning technology could advance, they talk about this in this article, they could advance so quickly that they could actually take your voice within the matter of 10 seconds and be able to do this. This is what the next level that they're talking about being implemented here and they're talking about, yeah, this is great for voice assistance, this is great for improving accuracy with speech to text devices and I'm like, look at the trade off we're making here. No, I don't care. I don't want better voice assistance, I don't want better speech to text, you know, technocratic or robotic devices listening to us all the time. I don't want any of that. This is the guys of what they're working with this technology for, but ultimately, if you don't think this is going to be weaponized or already is weaponized, you're fooling yourself and they're talking about this technology going on the market, being available to the average person within a few years or even sooner. And some of the experts on this topic talking about this. And again, when you match in the kind of Jordan Peele audio because Jordan Peele had to fake in the audio with the fake Obama video, you can mix in this technology where again, real-time, life-like, just like we saw in Running Man, fake videos as they are happening, which wouldn't surprise me because, you know, we cover a lot of the bigger geopolitical stories. We did one about how the investigation to the chemical weapons attack in Syria, a lot of the information was hidden, a lot of the information was faked, a lot of the bigger truths about that were suppressed. And again, imagine what you could do to push a war, a promote something extremely negative to society with this capability, which again, our government, our quote, intelligence agencies have been caught doing time and time again. And again, this is going to hit us sooner than we realize. Technological advancements usually have an up curve that far surpasses our human capabilities. And I was even affected by this. You know, a girl I was dating once, she had a deep fake, she was a personality of course, but she had a deep fake pornographic video made of her. And again, it's like, what the hell? What kind of world are we living in where people are literally making fake pornographic videos with individuals that they, you know, lost after. And of course, pornographic websites have said that they're going to, like Pornhub said that they're going to go after them and try to take them down and have a war against deep fakes. But soon this technology is going to get so advanced, it's going to be impossible to tell what is real and what is not. And you know, it's just, and obviously even with the deep fake pornography, you could still see, you know, the kind of face moving low. Every frame is not matched up perfectly, but it's soon to be almost impeccable and almost perfect and almost virtually impossible to even know the difference between what is real and what is fake. And that's a little scary there, Jason. Well, I want to let people know already that technology is available to a guy like me. It's not, you know, commercially available to somebody who can just get on a phone and be like, I want to put this here and make a video. No, but that's how these things are happening, you know, through software like Adobe. You can go online right now if you've got a powerful enough PC. If you've got enough input devices, yeah, you know, you got enough time rendering power. It's out there. It's something I've considered doing just to kind of make a point. Now if you've seen the Jennifer Lawrence Steve Buscemi video, that is pretty impeccable. That is extremely well done. Obviously using her voice and not Steams, but facially, it's almost unrecognizable. You're watching something out of bizarro world. It's a high level deep fake. And here's the thing. It's double-edged sword with technology guys. For instance, you know, you could have a criminal be caught on video, have a lot of money, have a lot of power. You don't know where the source of that video is. It's 20 years down the line. He claims deep fake. He really did the crime. He really murdered somebody on camera. Now the other side of that is somebody has a deep fake made of them murdering or doing something terrible to another person and they don't have an alibi. They happen to be somewhere where maybe they didn't have their cell phone or they didn't have somebody around them and they can't verify that that's not them and they get convicted of that crime. These are just some of the moral conundrums that are going to come up with this tool. And let's face it, with these type of tools, you know, there's a lot of entertainment and parody possibilities, but there are a ton, ton of blackmail possibilities, real or fake otherwise. Luke, you got anything else to say or should I clear it out? I mean, this pretty much matches in line with what we talked about yesterday with Woody Harrelson's face being used to capture a beer thief. So the technological advancements are increasing in such a way that we have to be more critical and more skeptical than ever of what we see and hear out there. And that's what we're trying to do here. Jason, yeah, feel free to close it off. Guys, we're doing four videos a day. Except for on Saturday, you'll get two videos today and hopefully an email. So sign up to the email list, by the way, guys. But please share this stuff on social media. Make sure that you're subscribed to both News for a Change and We Are Change. Thumbs it up, ring that bell for notifications and get out there and watch Running Man while you be the change you want to see in the world."}

They got to come up with these Smart monkeys in the middle the ones that aren't just so a real monkey are probably just the little tiny spider monkey things that Go through the trees super fast and they come down and they steal steal people's foods the ones that are like abundant and People see them all the time. They're like pests in a lot of parts of Asia That monkey totally real But they need you to Think that you are some sort of evolved form of that and that's why they came out with most of these great apes the great apes are A huge hoax and they're there to push evolution and it's just Hollywood Look at the old stuff. So this video is on chimpanzees Go try to find the oldest photos of chimpanzees that you can find the only ones that exist are out of Hollywood and It's because it is straight out of Hollywood It is the same thing as the panda how Pandas you can't find old Chinese stuff with pandas painted enough because it's a modern hoax the chimpanzee is a very modern hoax Didn't exist in the 1800s the hoax of chimpanzees But they just it appears out of nowhere But at the same time they pretend that it's just always been there if there's monkeys out there that are super advanced Using tools they look like a human It would be a known thing but they'll tell you that So just for for instance on the chimpanzees Jane Goodall super modern is like one of the biggest people on chimpanzees of all time If chimpanzees were a real thing people would have been studying them for a really really long time But it's all so recent because it's a recent hoax and If you look at the old stuff, it's not good They want you to think that they're really dangerous, but then why are they always next to children? It's because they won't Well cognitive dissonance they they can have you believe whatever they want you to You can have conflicting beliefs all over the place because it's just They tell you so so you believe it They make you think that because this person is an actor. They have some sort of magical power over wild animals It's not a good one The old ones are bad It's part of the space hoax The gloves Just the hands you can tell are not from a real animal Sure, I mean it's a it's a convincing hoax, but That's what they do if they're hoaxers This was really bizarre this was really bizarre And I think that this is just in the 90 I think that what this is is just a really really old fake chimp And it doesn't even look like chimps today, but this is some sort of like tabloid type thing And I think that's what they do It's just a type thing Inside the bizarre the Sun Inside the bizarre world of human chimp hybrids. I think that this is just an old image of what they would claim as a chimpanzee But nowadays it just looks different And they're trying to say oh this was some human chimp hybrid there's no such thing as chimps They're all hoaxes human chimp hybrid It's just an old chimp that doesn't look like today's During a 666 over there I can see some duping the light there There's not many old images of these things You can go yourself and they don't look the same like this doesn't quite look like a chimp But it's because it's an old one I think the gloves look really really chunky on this old one. I Don't think the gloves look like this anymore. These look like bad bad ones Look at that That's why there's not many images old images of these they're probably just Because they're bad what you you're gonna have this wild animal that is known known for ripping apart faces You're gonna put it next to a bunch of little little children. No, it's some midget in a fursuit There's no risk they're always having them dress up like a human it's a big meme PG tips, I guess it was a big thing for this tea company to use them Can't do this to wild animals, okay Cannot have wild animals do this Jane Goodall's a trainee and There's no way that the leading expert in something Would be in the 60s for something like this that would be so extraordinary so extraordinary extraordinary for there to be Animals out there that are using tools and very human-like It would be a well-known well documented well studied things. Why weren't they studied? When Africa was colonized it's because it's a BS species that they just pulled it out of thin air in the 1900s We need we need these links for evolution. So they make up the animal We have a duping delight over here. Oh Yeah, Jane Jane Goodall you just they just want you to think that this tranny is so magical that Wild animals are gonna run over and hug her these these vicious wild beasts their idols and their jokes and their trannies Prominently displaying the head in hand doesn't this doesn't look the same as today the old ones look different A little nap pan backwards Darwin's missing link that's why they came up with this So this was interesting chimp named Enoch and I think that they look bad The I think that the old ones Old ones shouldn't look worse That's not how real life works if you take a picture of a squirrel from the 1920s It's not gonna look like a worse squirrel But the chimps look worse And I'll say yeah, it was a It's a great deception They put a lot of effort This is where they put a lot of their effort into things like this fooling the public into Thinking that they're just a monkey taking you away from God things that can take you away from God is where they put in huge amounts of effort To gaslight you Look they're bad This one doesn't seem to have fangs and the fursuit just looks cheaper just look at the fursuit Doesn't look as good Always a bunch of sinister Looking people holding these chimps like little baby dolls. These are probably just dolls. Look at the hips, too There's some weird thing out of Kellogg's are you gonna have a wild animal next to your little baby? No, it's a hoax Their feet just look like these limp sausage things it's cuz that's just a fake That's not a real animal foot if monkey if chimpanzees were real They would have grip they would be gripping on to things with their feet But they're always just these lifeless sausage things In this one look at the hand it's just a human hand Sometimes it's just a realistic looking mask just on a human body you can just see that this is just a human body with a mask on it The hands it just looks like they have some fur and they painted them Just elaborate suits To me they look really dry like like a real animal wouldn't look so dry Maybe they're powdered up or something for the Hollywood effects This just looks like it's a human body some of them they just threw fur on a human body with a realistic looking face mask I mean look at the arms. That's just a human arm This one's just a human body with hair this one too, it's just a human body These were from the 1960s And I'll just end with animatronic chimps They have extenders they'll wear you can find all sorts of videos online of People pretending to be apes learning how to be apes and It's because that's it's a real thing that people do. It's a real acting gig People really do go pretend to be apes all day and enclosures at a zoo it really is you being watched They're watching you get fooled God bless everybody"}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_367", "transcript": "What is up YouTube? John Christon here going to show you how to build an email list for marketing without a website. No website needed for this in under 10 minutes. I'll be going over a few things with you today. Showing you free email marketing program that you can use. I'll also be showing you how you can create a sign-up form that's hosted on its own landing page. Even if you don't have a website, there's no need to register a website to make this happen. I'll also be showing you how to create your email marketing campaign. And I'll be giving you a free bonus at the end to help you get started making money with email marketing. So stay tuned, keep watching. Let's get into it. Once again, this is going to be a pretty hot video because we're going to be going over how to build an email list without even having a website. So this is pretty exciting. And also, we're going to do it in under 10 minutes. Can you start the timer? Yeah. Okay, cool. So we got the timer started. First go into the free email marketing program. And the free email marketing program we will be using. Let's go over my computer is called MailChimp. Now MailChimp is free to sign up for free to use. And as you can see right here, MailChimp all in one marketing platform. You just click on that in Google. I couldn't find an affiliate program for them. Otherwise, I would have put an affiliate link below. But there might be a link in the description. And what you do is you just click this button in the top right corner, like all programs, sign up for free right up there to get started. Now, keep in mind, there's a lot of additional resources that they have available for you to learn email marketing. And I'm going to be going over the basics. So you can always go deeper in in their resource file. Now, the first thing you do once you get signed into MailChimp is you need to create an audience. For basically an audience is kind of like a list or a segment, whatever you want to call it. But you'll go up here to the top left corner and you'll click create. Now once you're logged into MailChimp, the first thing you'll do is you'll need to create an audience which is also known as an email list. So in order to create an email list or an audience, we'll scroll down in the main area. You just click this button and it'll say audience. And right down here, it says create a list. So we're going to want to click that button right there to start creating our email list. So we'll click create a list. And in here, we'll want to say what our audience name is. So let's just say, I don't know, keto diet. I recently have been on the keto diet, you know, eating lots of nuts, vegetables, and meat, no carbs. Lost 15 pounds in the last two months. 15 pounds in two months. So pretty cool. I was getting a little big there for a while. I saw some of you commenters making fun of it. So you'll set up your audience name here and then you'll do your default from address. So let's just say I'm John Robert Cristani at gmail.com. Everybody send me emails. I love getting personal emails from all you and if you need money, anybody who sends me an email asking for money, I give money to. So default from name, we'll just say John Cristani. And you set up your information right down here. Okay. And then you just click save. So we have an audience now. We have an audience named keto diet. Now the next step that we actually take is we're going to actually need to create a landing page. So what you need to do up here is we're going to go up and click create. And then we will go down here to where it says landing page. And this is going to be a page that allows you to collect emails on it to go into your list. So let's just call our landing page name keto LP LP stands for landing page. And then we click begin right here. Now here we've arrived at a spot where we can select a number of different styles. It depends on I don't know what do you think looks best. Let's just say this wild country looks like the best fit. So we might say get fit and lose weight. And we will change this. So we click that. And then the button text will say get free information sent to your email now free information sent to your email now learn how I lost 15 pounds in two months on the keto diet. Maybe I want to make the font Georgia and maybe I want to make it a little bit bigger so that it shows up bigger. You can do a lot of things with this. Maybe you want to make it bold or italicized or underlined. Whatever you want to do you can do. And even if you wanted to change the picture you could change the image to something else. We're not going to do all of that right now. But the point being you can have a lot of fun with these templates and customize them how you want. What you do once you're done is you can click save and close right in the lower corner. So to finish it setting up you need to add a page title and you need to create a URL for your page. So we're just going to add a page title lose weight on the keto diet. And then we will add URL click this final step right there. So we'll just say use mail chimp domain and we will say keto diet. Then we will click save. So make sure once again you want to click use mail chimp domain. This way you can do this without having your own website. And you can collect emails which you can market to. Voila here we go. So here's our page and here's our link and you really want to save this link because this is pretty important right here. This link will go to your page. So you have a free web page right now. You have a free web page that people can sign up for and opt in on. Okay so now we finished all of the things all we need to do now is actually click publish. So I'm going to save I'm going to save this URL and I'm going to click publish and high five says our landing page is on the web. So let's check it out. And here we go. Look our web page is already live. We can enter in you know let's just say I'm going to say Henry Royal at gmail.com. We could say subscribe success you've been added to the audience. And if we go in our campaign builder here we can actually go under the dashboard and we can see well it might take a second to update but basically it will show us that we just added a subscriber and we have a web page. We have an email list we can mail to. We have everything we need to actually start marketing. Now how do you actually start marketing to people though? So last step is you'll want to go under create right here and you would do design and send regular or automated emails to your subscribers. And from there you go through the step by step process of being able to create that. Woo! So that should have been under 10 minutes that may have even been under five but in that you just learn how to build an email list set it up without a website in under 10 minutes and it's for marketing meaning the people are opting in it's going to be GDPR compliant. You can market to these people the difference with marketing is they opt in. If they don't opt in to be an email list you're technically violating spam laws when you send an email to them. So we're using MailChimp. There's a lot of other email service providers. I personally recommend SendGrid. SendGrid is first of all it's run by a freaking animal like just genius. Isaac he's amazing and if you haven't seen interviews of Isaac Salgata went to UC Riverside not too far from where I live in Malibu well it's in Southern California. He's an amazing entrepreneur he's got amazing vision and he's built an amazing company which does email better than any other company on the internet but MailChimp's great to start. You build a sign-up form you build a landing page a sign-up form and the landing page a website without having to register your own website and you created an email campaign. I'm going to give you a bonus. I said I was going to give you a bonus and the bonus is I want to work with you. I actually want to work with you. I want to make money together. I want to be partners and what I'd like to do is I'd like to encourage you to build email lists helping people learn ways they can earn money from home because this is a big problem.

I want to show people how they can make money from home and I want you to help me and you're going to get 90% of the commissions and I'm going to get 10%. I still end up making out all right.

In the Philippines it's to become a nurse. In Germany it's to go into finance. Every culture. In Iran it's to become a lawyer or a doctor. Every culture has their thing that they want their kids to be but many of these professions are boring, nepotistic, dying and they make you hate your life. Don't do that. Doesn't make sense. I make millions of dollars every year just doing teaching and doing marketing for other companies and you can too.

{"vid": "non_hate_video_376", "transcript": "So this is going to be the story of Tracy Hunter, a juvenile judge in Ohio who was just sentenced to six months basically for nepotism. All right? She abused her powers. She was indicted on eight counts back in 2014. She was sentenced in 2014. She appealed the decision, right? And after she appealed the decision in 2014, she stood there and it went the whole way to the Supreme Court and they gave a stay of, it was almost like a stay of execution. They stood there and said, you know, we're not gonna sit there and lock you up at the moment. We're gonna let you run your appeal out, which is honestly kind of insane, right? Like usually that does not happen, okay? She was accused of backdating documents and trying to prevent prosecutors from appealing her decisions against them and improperly used her position as a judge to give confidential documents to her brother, a juvenile court employee who was in the process of getting fired. Now, how was he, why was he getting fired? Because he had punched a child who was in his care. This is Ohio. Yo, I'm beyond a switch. Ohio is a fucked up place. The kid may have been completely the fuck out of line. All right? I'll be honest with you. But you know, in this modern day and age, you can't sit there and you know, actually, you know, hit somebody, right? So an octet, she was indicted in January 2014, eight counts. In October, a jury convicted Hunter of a single count related to giving the convention confidential documents to her brother after he testified in court that she gave him the documents of the Hamilton County juvenile jail. Last year, he was fired from his job for punching a juvenile inmate. According to prosecution witnesses, Judge Hunter requested documents, including medical information of that inmate involved in the incident. While the supervisors who run the jail testified, those who were unusual requests and thought it was a conflict of interest. Well, today, Stephen Hunter told the prosecutor his sister gave him the case file just one day before his disciplinary hearing. I got every every see them. I took them from death. Hunter to look at the file. Yes. And you give those documents to your lawyer? Yes, she was actually convicted of these crimes, right? And they gave her a sentence of six months and a year's worth of probation. All right. She stood here and filed for an appeal. Okay. The Ohio Supreme Court allowed her to remain out of jail while she pursued her appeals. And then she tried to have the judge Patrick Dick, Dick and Lacker, Dick Lacker, Link Lacker removed from the case. The Ohio Supreme Court Justice, Merino Connor denied this right now. After that in September 2015, her lawyer says that he can no longer represent her and he says he can no longer represent her because it's a conflict of interest because he also represented the judge in a drinking and driving case or something like that. Oh, it was a fatal crash where two vehicles had struck a woman. And this is Ohio. You know what I'm saying? Right? Now, in January 2016, the Supreme Court of Ohio upheld her her sentence. Okay. So in May of 2016, the US District Attorney Tim Black issued an emergency stay of her sentence and tells hunters attorneys that had filed a habeas Corpus petition arguing that she didn't get a fair trial because of mistakes by the judge and misconducts by the special prosecutors who handed the case. At a court hearing, Link Lacker says he calls to stay in overreach by a federal judge. The federal magistrate recommends denying hunters challenge their conviction. Black must make the final decision. Two years after the Madden's recommendation, Black in a 26-page decision says, Hunter's sentence can be imposed. He says, strong evidence against Hunter undermined her claims that the verdict was a result of inflammatory and prejudicial effect of remarks made by a special prosecutor during closing arguments. Now, so and then Monday, July 22, 2019, they actually had the sentencing hearing. All right. Once they finally got to the sentencing hearing, they stood here and they said, you will get a years worth of probation. All right. And six months in jail. And I'm going to show you some footage of that right now. And justice is thrown around a lot. Justice Manus in this particular case. So the court, Miss Hunter orders the execution of the sentence and throws on December 5, 2014 by Judge Nadel. That is as follows, one year community control that's non-reporting. Since you will be on community control, I will advise you as I'm required to by law. And if you violate any of the conditions of the post of the community control, come back in front of me. I will send you to 18 months to your high department corrections. It is a felony of the fourth degree. The conditions of the community control control are real simple. It's indicated in the judgment entry by Judge Nadel. Number one, you pay the cost of these proceedings. Number two, you are to do not violate any laws. Number three, you are to do six months in the Hamilton County Justice Center credit one day. Mr. Deputy can take her away. No! So why did this happen? Why was there a full chimp out after a fucking decision to send her to the county for six months? First off, she's going to a female facility. All right. And like I want everybody to understand like a female facility is I don't even know like how to explain what a female facility is like. It's like basically just going to like I don't even know how like it's like the most basic as far as just a place you go hang the fuck out for six months. All right. It's like a female facility is not anything like a male facility in any way shape or form. Like you go to the county as a man. It's going to suck a lot. All right. Because like legitimately, you know, it is what it is. Right. But going to the county as a female is a whole different animal. Like it's pretty fucking basic. You know, just go and fucking do your time, read, sleep, whatever. And I mean, nobody goddamn bothers you, you know, might pick up a lesbian, love a Y. You there, whatever. You know what I mean? Fucking. But yeah, it's usually just out of your choice. It's not the fact that somebody makes you their bitch. Right. It's a it's a whole different animal. And the county like usually the gay shit don't don't really happen as often unless you're in like a jungle. I mean, which I mentioned the jungle before, which is going upstate, you know, I mean, in which case, you know, I'm saying like, yeah, well, now you might have to protect your booty hole. I mean, you know, I mean, sleep on your back. It is what it is. But on top of that, they stood here and turned her into this symbol of black women, you know, I mean, who are strong and don't need no man I'm a Paul, I believe it's a travesty. And my question is, where's the kitchen sink? Everything's been thrown except the kitchen sink. And this has been an assault against this judge since 2010, when everything possible was done, spent almost $2 million taxpayer money trying to stop this judge from being seated. That didn't work. The attacks continue. And hey, one thing I know is the truth is what makes one free. Right. Because like fucking they stood here and they spent all this money to get this broad goddamn elected in a pretty black district. And she came in with the mentality of, you know, fucking all these white men are racist and they've been abusing the system forever, which I'm not gonna lie. Like most judges do abuse the fucking system. And I mean, like it is what it is. Like it's rare that you run across a real straight ass straight arrow fucking judge like the vast majority of you want them to be fucking lenient. And I'm you want to have a chance to not be a buy the book motherfucker, you know, like you, you don't want to judge who goes directly by the book all the time because you're gonna end up getting a book thrown at you. Like that's just how that shit operates. So you know, you kind of do want that. And the problem is, is that like she thinks that like all of them are completely corrupt pieces of shit. And she assumed that she could just go in there and be a completely corrupt piece of shit. Didn't even wait for a time in didn't learn nothing, you know what I'm saying? You could tell that she's batshit as fucking crazy just by the look on the motherfucker face. Her being dragged out of the courtroom with the fireman's carry. That was fucking hilarious. You know, I mean, that dead weight, dead weight, dead weight. Lock arms. Like man, listen, you know, I mean, you know, and that fat bitch was also arrested who jumped over the motherfucking jumped over the joint and went to went towards the motherfucking bench to fight the bailiff and shit. She was also locked up for contempt to court and assault in an officer, which she should be and she'll probably get longer than the judge did because she doesn't have the judges fucking resources. And I mean, nobody gives a fuck about her and she doesn't have a name. And see, this is why it's so hard to prosecute fucking politicians and individuals who are corrupt, because they're able to hide behind this bullshit of I'm a black female, I'm a white female, you know what I mean? I'm a fucking elderly individual, you know, I fucking come from I'm a Native American, whatever the case might be, right? And then, you know, you have to fight their whole group to get them to fuck and go to goddamn jail, you know, and you piss everybody off when you fucking lock them up. The reality is she's a corrupt piece of shit. And on I'm saying like legitimately, like, yo, if it was your kid that that dude hit, you know what I mean? And like the kid hadn't done anything to normalize that, which I don't fucking believe to be honest with you. And I mean, but the fact that if a judge stood here and ruled against you in that favor, like say you were up for something and the judge stood there and fucked you by giving, you know, I mean, the DA some shit that they weren't allowed to fucking have, you'd feel some sort of kind of way about it, you know, and this is really where the fuck it's at. This is really the mentality of where all this gets down to like, yo, look, you can't be having individuals out here just abusing their motherfucking power and getting their family members to fuck off of criminal charges. Oh, really? No, Lee, whenever the fuck they want to, that's that's not how fucking democracy works. That's not how our justice system works. That's not how shit set the fuck up. And I understand that like black people think there's been a lot of racial inequality like the reality. It's not an army. It's not the situation. It's feminism and garbage and bullshit and females rights, which have really fucked the black community. Because if you have a conversation with an older black dude who's like 50, 60 years old and you talk to him about being back in the 70s and they'll tell you their whole their family owned blocks of land, you know what I'm saying? And fucking like, yo, they have they had massive amounts of rental properties and shit. They were on a come up. And then all of a sudden all this bullshit came through with the female rights and the corporatism and all the nonsense. And all of it went down to fucking toilet. And the same thing happened to most of the white community. And, you know, we were talking about a movie last night, falling down, which, you know, like it's it's all around the board. But white people aren't allowed to bitch because like, oh, man, well, white men got all the motherfucking privilege out of this. I'm like, yo, but 1% of the white men did. Right? Like out of, you know, I mean, the 200 million 220 million 230 million 250 260 million white men and this white people in this fucking country. And I mean, yo, it was like 1% of those motherfuckers got all the privilege. Like what 26,000 of us, you know what I mean? And the rest of us all got fucked. You know what I mean? Like legit. And that's really where it's at. The rest of us all lost money. We all lost wages, ended up in debt and fucked up and losing our families and a whole bullshit in our society being in our culture and everything being crushed and destroyed. That's the reality of things. You know what I mean? Like, yo, and we have to have this conversation publicly, you know what I mean? Have this motherfucking shit. And I'm not even anti like it would have 1% gain in the money. It just something has to give something has to fucking change so that the middle class and the lower middle class working poor and I mean, can have an opportunity to be upwardly mobile because right now they're downwardly mobile. Just as a state of opinion, the state of facts. You know what I mean? It is what it is. You can go, oh, man, you know, you hear Ben Shapiro and fucking couple of people don't like, you know, fucking, this is the one country in the world where if you're born poor, there's a good chance you're not gonna die poor. You know, and that's not the truth anymore. Like you're taking a measurement from fucking 50 years ago and blind it today and it's just not true. It is what it is. In the meantime, man, yo, this is Tom P's of P Noi News. If you guys enjoyed the motherfucking video, I'll let you fucking boy. Peace."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_380", "transcript": "The truth is the most important thing there is. Without truth we have nothing. Because in order to have something, it needs to exist. And you don't know if something exists if you don't have the truth. So knowingly ignoring the truth to appear as a group is the greatest possible sacrifice one can make. To sacrifice the truth to appear as a group is to accept the belief that the group is more important than existence itself. Which is inherently self-destructive. And the thing is the majority of people are evolved to do that. Right? So if you don't have someone at the top who is primarily concerned with truth, telling the group what to think and just leaving the group to their own devices, you're fucked. Because the group when left to think for themselves is inherently self-destructive, it makes me sick. This world makes me physically sick to my stomach. It's like a household where the children decide how much candy they can eat and when they can go to bed. Where's the father? Where is he? Where is the man who understands that people need to be forced to do what is uncomfortable because it is good for them. Because as children they won't make those decisions themselves. They're only concerned with what feels good. But what feels good isn't always good for you. Right? Right. So when I say we need to genocide the fucking Christ just like God tells us to do in the Bible, it feels uncomfortable. But if you are able to see the creations in every walk of life, you would understand why it's possible that you can't. Because in the dark and people are system-blind, they're not physically capable of seeing the connections of all different facets of understanding. Exactly. There's a father who lives with me. If you're opposed to what emotions come first, you're not ever going to be able to decide for yourself what is best for you. As we're showing these people what is best to have emotions come first. So in a candy field it's good, right? Yeah. But it's not good for you. There's one thing like that in life. The field, the field for it, the doing them feels, the doing them is bad for you. And then there's other things that feel bad. But doing them is the right thing to do. It's healthy and it makes you feel better in the long run. Right? And sort of people that are primarily emotional rather than rational in their thinking. And they're going to come up with the best thing to do. Yep. Coming up. Without you, I'm very emotional. And I'm not very good at thinking of things."}

The official, the original, home for Coon Shadden. Find all the Coons you can handle at CoonWatch.com. It amazes me that to convince black people that Donald Trump cares about them, he takes pictures with celebrities. So, DL, I guess you are saying that Trump is the only president that takes pictures with celebrities. The Coons. It amazes me that to convince black people that Donald Trump cares about them, he takes pictures with celebrities. It's amazing to me. If Donald Trump cared about black people, he wouldn't have denigrated the president with those claims of birtherism. He wouldn't have stoked fears and racist fears of saying this man is less than or is not one of us to become president. If Donald Trump cared about the concerns of black people, he wouldn't have in the debates talked about bringing back Stop and Frisk. Stop and Frisk? Now that's a valid point. But DL is more concerned about his love of Obama than real black matters. Check out this love fest. Millions and millions watched the president give his farewell address to the nation. I think it was full of optimism. Optimism? Wasn't that President Obama's farewell speech? I think it was full of hope. Oh, again, are we talking about President Obama's farewell speech? I think it was full of nostalgia. I think it was all the reasons that we loved him and followed him for eight years. If Donald Trump cared about black people, Jeff Sessions would most certainly not be his pick to head the Justice Department. Donald Trump takes pictures with black people. Having a comedian and a rapper and a football player out to talk about the concerns of the community. DL. Didn't President Obama meet with a rapper, Jay-Z, a football player, a whole lot of them, and a comedian, you, if you still consider one, and a few booty shapers, Fergie and Beyonce? All while denying the black caucus access to him and putting his bulldog, Revan L. Sharpton, on them if they dare step out of line. You know why you have a comedian, a rapper, and a football player out to talk about the concerns of the community? Because that's the positions you're used to seeing us in. You would rather see a football player, a rapper, and a comedian. So what happens if a rapper, a football player, and a comedian enter an Obama inauguration party? The rapper's wife will show you her ASS. You'd rather have black people be football players, comedians, and rappers than the president. You'd rather see us run the ball than run the country. That's why you do it. I ain't gonna never forget what you said about this man and how you got where you are. Some people might, but I never will. I'll never forget how you denigrated his family. I'll never forget how you stoked fears. Fuck you now and fuck you forever. Yeah, it really does talk tough, doesn't it? Maybe he's upset that Trump is not his white daddy. So let's watch this coon, this his mama, at show love for his white daddy. I won the apple when I got it to my mother and she did the apple and she said this apple is rotten just like you are. And I laughed and I told him that story and said you're not rotten, you're gonna be something. And I'll never forget that. And I hope he's as proud of me as I am. Good job, good job. Good job, good job. T-W-O-D-J-O-V. Good job, good job. So this coon, this his mama and she has some tears for his white daddy. Typical blind side, green mouth, the health, hidden figures, white savior, coon shit. But he's not through with black women. Let's wrap up with this coon clowning, black college girls, so he could get approval from another white daddy. We called them hoes and uh, nappied hoes and they weren't hoes. But it was some nappied women on that team. Shut up, I'm gonna say it, I don't give a damn y'all like it or not, you know it's true. Them are some of the uppies women I've ever seen in my whole life. Get the hell out of here, close that door. I don't want to be a coon no more. Ah, down the hair, coon ass nigga. Listen here boys and girls, I got something for you. Don't worry about getting no black man little girl. Don't worry about getting no black woman little boy. And when you grow up, don't worry about your kids. You don't need to worry about that. All you need to do is do some good for white folks. And the white folks love you, if they love you, you'll be alright child. You'll be with God.

{"vid": "non_hate_video_404", "transcript": "Justice League Dark issue number one from DC Comics. I know this is late, but I literally just got this issue this Wednesday I wanted to do a review on it when it came out, but the copies at my local comic book store got damaged and the new shipment literally did not come in until this past Wednesday, so Yeah, I was I was debating on whether I should review this or not I mean I really liked and stuff like that, but I have other comics I was thinking of doing since they got released this week as well. Looks like maybe your Fatum number two spawn Witchblade or maybe detective comics I'm not doing them now because I haven't had a chance to read any of them yet They'll probably do one of these on Monday I'm kind of leaning towards fatum just because it's been a while since I've reviewed that one I literally reviewed the last issue of detective comics just a while ago But I don't know how much you guys decide Which one of these three you want me to review? I was thinking of doing Red Hood and the Outlaws because I've heard that you know the latest issues a lot of crazy things went down, but Again the issues didn't get destroyed Instead for some reason the Comics got delivered to the wrong store so my local comic book store got You know some comics from another place and the other place got comics from my local comic book store. Yeah, it's I I Don't know what the hell's going on. I don't blame my local comic book store at all. I blame the delivery, but It seems like there's always an issue especially what one of the series that I want to read either the comics are destroyed upon delivery or They get shipped to another store. So we have to wait another week or two but yeah, surprisingly even Domino got Got shipped to the wrong place So I can't review Domino either So we're gonna do Justice League dark and then when I get the chance to read one of those other three issues We're doing on those on Monday, so Isn't it kind of funny how The DC animated movies are so freaking good and then the live actions is really terrible I don't know why they don't just get the same people who like wrote and direct the animated series to go Do one of the live actions. I bet it would probably turn out pretty good I know obviously there's a difference between directing a cartoon and directing the live action, but I Don't know. I feel like Zach Snyder is like the wrong person to kind of helm up the DC universe And the last said about Josh Sweden the better But yeah, so we start off with Zaytana or Zaytana Doing a magic trick and It going wrong like she's gonna do the classic pull the bunny the hats and the bunny comes out dead And then a giant Almost Cthulhu like beast when I say Cthulhu actually I should say Cthulhu. I should say the crafty and like beasts He rubs from her hat and starts attacking the audience And then what a woman comes for the save Here's the thing I'm not like a gents Wonder Woman being in this but Basically the new just a league dark team is kind of helmed by her I don't know if she's gonna end up being the leader or if she's just kind of pulling a Batman where she's gathering the team together And then she's gonna kind of step aside and like Zaytana lead but I'm not the biggest fan of Wonder Woman leading the magic team. I get it's like, you know, she comes from a land That has magic. She uses magical items, but I just I really don't associate her with magic Not to mention the fact that she already has a team Justice League So I just I hate when like others like I hate when the top three get shoehorned into everything I'm not saying she's shoehorned into this but Give you know Constantine the the helm again. I mean his whole thing is supernatural and magic I mean she already has her team and I just I don't know. I just don't want Matt I just don't really want her to helm that this team as well. It's just I Just I just I don't know I don't like it when Superman Batman or Wonder Woman are going around like leading a bunch of teams Then again, I don't really like when superheroes in general or I spread across so many different series like when they're kind of contained to their own thing but so Yeah, we get a fight scene between Between Wonder Woman and Zetana against the creature So yeah Zetana Here's like our only thing with Constantine. He kind of just shows up and he's he's asking her if If she's gone like any news and clues and stuff like that on the magic basically I like this idea for a surround basically magic is turning against its users and That's I don't know to me. That's like a really cool idea And this with everybody everybody who's trying to use magic for some reason like the spells and things like that are going against them One of the things that was Constantine Killed Zetana's father by Burning him alive with one of the spells for she he didn't do it on purpose. But yeah, I like that whole story idea. It's really cool We get a little bit more where the Wonder Woman is talking to Detective Chimp and the forgot what the name of the bar was The Say the oblivion bar the oblivion bar that we saw in DC Comics The reason why I move the camera I was just because I don't want to show all the pages but Yeah, basically she's talking to Detective Chimp who I'm a fan of The Dark Knight's metal made me a fan of Detective Chimp plus. I mean come on. He's a he's a monkey that solves crime Like that's awesome But yeah, we get we get some pretty cool horrifying scenes where basically yeah magic is just like turning against people and This is like love crafting stuff right here But yeah, basically the whole stick of this issue is that Magic is turning against his users So Wonder Woman Goes to a bar Drinks with a monkey that solves crime and they decide to put a team together That premise um So yeah, we get like some of the other supernatural characters Who deal a lot with magic getting together and kind of talking about how? the events of the Dark Knight's metal the breaking of the the wall has somehow leaked in some presence that is affecting their magic and They got a They got to do something to to fix this And the azitana is there and she notices a swamp thing is spying on them Oh This action comics action comics sucks anyone see the delayed Superman Play Superman issue where where Batman announces to the Justice League that he has Diarrhea and he needs to pull out of the Batmobile so he can take a shit because that literally happened No joke that this isn't me like trying to fool you guys that that literally happened and They also had Barry With wallies hair style and color Like they made Barry a redhead. I think that was just a colorist mistake. Basically. There's no editors When it comes to Bendis and yeah, a lot of people were giving Ben is the chance And I felt like I was one of the only people who like I didn't even want to give him any like not even a sliver of a chance Some people were like, oh, you know, he might do bad, but maybe maybe he might do good I'm like, no, he's gonna he's gonna fuck it up and he did you fucked up Superman Also because of him we now get a bunch of We got what Wonder Woman being ruined Aquaman's gonna be ruined Yeah, see I mean when you bring in Ben is you don't just bring in Bendis you bring in all Bendis his friends So Yeah, it was nice knowing you DC But your Batman sucks your Superman sucks your Wonder Woman is gonna suck Even though she has been kind of sucking lately your Aquaman is gonna suck I mean Stay away from my Green Lanterns So far I think the Green Lanterns are gonna be gonna be okay I think we got Grant Grant Morrison from if I remember this correctly He's gonna be doing how Jordan and then we got Juergens who's doing Green Lantern. He's been doing an amazing job on that But yeah, stay away from them Red Hood and yellow From what I've understood I don't know if I'm gonna be liking the direction it's gonna be going But we'll see I don't want to judge without reading the issue but uh, yeah, basically the the Arrival of Bendis is kind of taking DC in a very bad direction so Yeah, we get we go to the Justice League dark fortress Where we have man bat who is Doing good, I guess he's he's working with Wonder Woman now and we get more of the Horrifying results of people using magic Yeah I'm gonna end this here because I don't want to show the rest because I think you guys should read this issue I don't want to spoil anything But I just don't want to show all the all the pages for copyright reasons, but this is a Great issue. I really liked it again My one nitpick is and this this is just completely my opinion people could you know completely disagree with me I'm just I don't like Wonder Woman. I don't find I Don't think she should she should be Part of the Justice League dark even though she uses magic and stuff like that. It's not really her. She's not known for her magic so Yeah, ignore my dogs. So yeah, pick it up good issue Hope you guys enjoyed I have I'm not gonna know I'm not gonna plug all that stuff. I'm just gonna say if you guys like this, please hit the Subscribe button if you haven't already hit the bell for notification leave a like comment share this with your friends and family I do have a twitch that I stream if you guys are interested in enjoying that You can find a link to that in the information below along with other stuff And yeah, tell me tell me which one of these three would you guys like to see? because unless I decide to get digital versions of Comics that I'm missing I'm not gonna be getting those for another week or two. So Anything between these three you guys would like to see just let me know and I will review it on Monday But I hope you guys enjoy it and I'll catch you guys next time later"}
{"vid": "non_hate_video_405", "transcript": "Britain First is a hateful organisation. It seeks to spread division and mistrust among our communities. We need societies that recognise diversity as a source of strength. We believe our diversity makes us stronger. Our diversity is a strength. Mr Trump will not become president because the American people understand that our strength is in our diversity. A study by the Pew Research Centre has predicted that Europe's Muslim population will likely double by 2050. The research on Muslim beliefs in Britain was not all positive. Almost half said they would not turn to the police if someone they knew became involved with IS or someone linked to Syrian terrorism. More than a quarter don't even think extremism exists. Egypt 80 million Muslims and almost 70% said they had positive or mixed feelings about bin Laden. In 2013, just over a quarter said suicide bombings or targeting civilians was justified. Two thirds said honour killings of women can sometimes be justified. Turkey has 74.7 million Muslims. 82% said honour killings of women could be justified sometimes. Iraq 31.1 million Muslims live there. 78% say honour killings of women can sometimes be justified. Afghanistan 24 million people. A huge majority 76% support at least occasionally just once in a while honour killings of women. Jordan smaller Muslim countries 6.4 million Muslims. Right now Hamas is enjoying like 60% approval rating. Palestinian areas 78% of those have positive or mixed feelings about bin Laden. 89% support terror attacks on our ally Israel. How about in the west? That was taken to France. France 4.7 million Muslims live there. A 2007 poll showed 35% of French Muslims said suicide bombing speech sometimes to justify. Great Britain 2.8 million Muslims living there. 78% wanted cartoonists of Mohammed legally prosecuted. How about here in the United States? According to Pew Research. 13% said violence against civilians could be justified. 19% said they were either favourable toward al-Qaeda or just didn't know. Who knows? Who knows? When it comes to support for terrorism and jihad, these are the numbers for young Muslims aged 18 to 29 in western countries. 42% of French Muslims, 35% of British Muslims and 26% of American Muslims believe suicide bombings against non-Muslims can be justified.

It's back in a time when chimps didn't have the the danger element 70s were a pretty wacky time and They hadn't yet written it into the bio of chimps that they can be super aggressive and rip people's face off and all that We see that with the fake animals the lore changes just like the the look will change They'll make up new stories that never used to exist One that I always think of is slawds. They like to talk about how slawds grow moss on their back these days They never used to talk about that and nowadays you can find really absurd looking photo shops where they just like spray some green on the back If you go watch old footage of slawds, they never talk about the moss thing and they don't have moss on their backs so Just like that chimps They eventually realized hey these well they like to put a danger element to make people scared and stay away If you make something scary, it makes it really easy for people to stay away from it But I mean just realistically these big animals shouldn't be so easily trainable and friendly all the time It really is absurd. So they had to put a danger element into it That's why they have hoax stories of people falling in the enclosures and They have hoax stories of people that have these as pets. Nobody has a chimp as a pet. It's not a real thing. It's a fursuit and Look at the one-eye symbolism we have here There's a bunch of one-eye symbolism in this opening and I'll just I'll play it. I think it's gonna speak for itself Chimps are straight out of Hollywood. It's a satanic deception Lance a lot link the secret Chimp, what's the secret the secret is that chimps are fursuits Exciting I guess there's 17 episodes of this Riding riding go-karts. Did you see that? An alleged chimp riding a go-kart.

{"vid": "non_hate_video_418", "transcript": "prompted this piece that someone sent to me. I thought I'd share it with you. It's called growing up. Few commentaries on this global warming hoax have had greater relevance than this. I think I might send it to Al Gore and it says this to all the school kids going on strike for climate change. You're the first generation who've required air conditioning in every classroom. You want TV in every room and your classes are all computerized. You spend all day and night on electronic devices. More than ever you don't walk or ride bikes to school, but you arrive in caravans of private cars that choke suburban roads and worsen rush hour traffic. You're the biggest consumers of manufactured goods ever and update perfectly good expensive luxury items to stay trendy. Your entertainment comes from electric devices. Furthermore, the people driving your protests are the same people who insist on actually inflating the population growth through immigration, which increases the need for energy, manufacturing and transport. The more people we have, the more forest and bushland we clear. The more of the environment that's destroyed. How about this? Tell your teachers to switch off the air con, walk or ride to school, switch off your devices and read a book, make a sandwich instead of buying manufactured fast food. No, none of this will happen because the piece says you're selfish, badly educated, virtue signaling little turds, inspired by the adults around you who crave a feeling of having a noble cause, while they indulge themselves in Western luxury and unprecedented quality of life. The piece ends by saying wake up, grow up and shut up until you're sure of the facts before protesting."}

It begins with genocidal Israel that sits on stolen land covered with the blood of its centuries-old possessors, the Palestinians, who've been slaughtered and dispossessed by the Jews. Alongside is greater Israel, the hegemonic mischief maker that uses America to fight its wars in Syria, Iraq, Hanifor, Lebanon and Iran. Moving beyond is gigantic Israel, entrenched in the political culture of the US and Europe and embedded in the Jewish global army, NATO. Lieberman spilled the beans. I agree with John McCain that when the president turned over leadership to NATO, in one sense that was exactly the right thing to do because we can't fight every good fight in the world alone. We need our allies. I appreciate that they've come in. But we're the heart of NATO and it's not exactly as if we took the ball and gave it to NATO. We're still NATO. If America is the heart of NATO, then given Jewish influence in D.C., Israel pumps its genocidal blood through NATO's global veins. Western civilization has morphed into the Elantus' security state, which throws Europe under America's bus, beholden to Zionist interests. For with the individual cooperation program, ICP, the Mediterranean Dialogue and with an Israeli ambassador to NATO, Israel burrows itself within the Western security state. Mr. General Secretary General, I want to start by thanking you for the important and welcome decisions to allow Israel to open an office at NATO's headquarters. This will help Israel and it will help NATO, I hope, strengthening our cooperation and our good relation. I will help, it will help us share best practices and information. That means Mossad, with genocidal Israel, greater Israel, gigantic Israel, spinning its web through shared private information, Mossad can stealthily advance a Jewish agenda. And like a spider in tangling its prey, the three Israels, with its foreign lobbies, embassies and participation in stacks of security networks, Jewries' quest for a one-world governance is hard to shake. International Jewry at the center of Zionism wheels the levers of global finance. Forex, Swift, letters of credit, forfeiting, along with its control of the West Central banks. Jerome Powell is simply gentle window dressing. Roll up the blinds and the three Israels, backed by a global Jewish financial system, loom large in the shadows. And what's hidden in the shadows Israel's nukes need not fire, for Israel's tentacles have spread throughout the world."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_447", "transcript": "I found myself back in my prayer room. I found my spirit very disturbed. Why everybody's preparing for the final four and March madness. Things that ran in the newspapers have disturbed me. I'm trying to figure out if his black lives really matter. Then in Chicago along the murder rate of sort 72% in 2016. 88% in the first three months of 2016 compared to last year. I'm trying to ask the question if to the organization of black lives is if they really mattered then why not write it now. There was 141 murders this year 82 murders last year at the same time. I'm trying to figure out in my mind why no one is paying attention to black men killing black men. Why we always find ourselves as the victims and now we have the separation once again that we're being victimized because of one bad white cop, two bad white cops, three bad white cops killing young black brother. But every day we have black on black crime killing each other. Police in Chicago reported 677 shoes this year. Last year it was 359. March murder rate rose by 29%. But we're not riding in the streets when black on black crime are killing each other. I'm trying to figure out how the month of March there's more murders in the month of March in Chicago than there are days in the month. 45 murders in the month of Chicago. There was 271 shooting incidents. I'm trying to stop the access one simple thing. When will we appreciate who we are? When will our skin color start paying attention to our own skin color? When will we stop crying that black lives matter because God says I am Alpha and Omega. I am creator of all and all come up under me with my spirit which means color means nothing. I am king. I will live as king but we have found our way distracted. We found our way distracted because things we're not paying attention to. The murders in 2015 and 2016 just a comparison to Chicago should be sad enough. 2015 there was 34 murders. 2016 there was 45. From January 1st to March 31st there was 82 murders in 2015. There was 141 in 2016. Let's just talk about the shootings. The shootings in 2015 there was 179. 2016 there was 271. January 1st to March 31st the shootings alone. 2015 there was 359. 2016 there was 677. The shooting victims in 2015 there was 204. In 2016 there was 319. From January 1st to March 31st there was 411. In 2015 there was 677 murders in 2016. And I'm trying to ask what's the problem? I was asked if I was an elected official what would I do to stop some of this violence? I would put barrels on each corner and I would give you 30 days to drop all illegal weapons in these barrels. And if you found yourself going outside of that the moment I found you with them that's 25 years mandatory. There's no more having conversations because what's starting to happen now is we're starting to confuse our kids. Our kids don't know which way to walk the streets. We got babies in Baltimore being shot in the middle of the streets. They're on the front porch and they're being shot. We got a family of five to six sitting in the backyard having a barbecue and the whole entire family gets executed. But we keep screaming black lives matter. If they really matter then let's do ourselves a favor. Let's stop killing black folks. Let's take it way back to when we once was understood what slavery was all about. Slavery was about togetherness and understand that we must overcome together. Not that we must separate ourselves to highlight our skin color. If you want to highlight our skin color, highlight the people that's doing the successful things in the communities that we should be highlighting. And it ain't all athletics. Athletics come a dime a dozen. But the impact of your journey and the things that we're supposed to be doing, you're supposed to be leaving an impact to change people's lives. One day God won't ask how many Super Bowls I won, how many tackles I made, or how many interceptions I have. He will ask the simple question, how many lives have I changed? Oh our comfort zone must be disturbed. We got music now that kids can't listen to what they parent. We got rated on shows that's showing things that kids have a way. Social media has took us way beyond where we supposed to be. We've dumbed the long term thinking in our minds. We've letting kids now dictate what they can do and who they can be and what they will ultimately be. I found myself disturbed. Whether I'm right or wrong, there's facts. There's numbers. Men and women lie. But numbers don't. Numbers don't lie. And what's going on in Chicago right now? If you write music, change your thought process. Change your language. Stop insulting women. We all got our struggles. There's nothing about me that's perfect. I'm a struggling man every day of my life to walk the right path. I haven't figured it all out yet. But I figured out enough to say that there's something and I'm supposed to pass along that don't go through my same struggles. Let's write something different. Let's give these lost children something to really envision. I cried today to say I'm not a perfect man. And I have my failures just like anyone else. But I guess the question is, are you helping or you serving? You can help anybody. You can give your money away to help any cause. But to serve, to serve, you must come out of your comfort zone. There's too many brothers killing each other. Brothers, if I had one message for you, man, stop and check the pulse of the person before you pull a trigger and realize that they are alive. And everybody you hurt, you will be accounted for. Man, I'm talking about, I'm man foolish people on social media, the things that they say that's pure ignorance, evil exists. Social media has become the devil's playhouse because it has foolish ignorant people who can hide behind captions of children and pictures and funny things and insult people who's actually doing something. But one day we will all be held accountable. And brothers, if nobody else won't scream to you, I'm going to scream to you. I know Black Lives Matter because I'm a Black man. But men stop killing each other. Man, we got to put these guns down in Chicago. Baltimore, Miami, man, it ain't that hard, man. Man, you got to be okay with earning the right living, man. He ain't supposed to be easy. Man's days on this earth will be short and filled with trouble. But right now, man, we're losing the battle. A third of the Afro-American population is behind bars. 50% are behind bars because they took the life of another Black man. Sooner or later, Black man. If we don't change what we're doing, not only will our kids not have a future, but we might find ourselves extinct. Listen here, boys and girls, I got something for you. Don't worry about getting no Black man, little girl. Don't worry about getting no Black woman, little boy. And when you grow up, don't worry about your kids. You don't need to worry about that. All you need to do is do some good for White folks. And if White folks love you, if they love you, you'll be alright, child. You'll be with God.

{"vid": "non_hate_video_457", "transcript": "Hi everybody, my name is Candace Owens and you are watching my vlog series, The Myth of the Coon. So, foremost, why the word Coon that is socially unacceptable? Why would someone who is African American say the word Coon? The first answer is because I can. The second answer is because it's important that I do. To me, obviously, I believe that the word Coon is a myth in the African American community which actually systematically, words like Uncle Tom and Coon, these words systematically oppress black people, which is quite ironic when said against the fact that the people that champion these phrases tend to think that they are the core of the black evolvement and the black movement. To give you guys a current event, a recent example of this in the press is the Colin Kaepernick, Neverending Saga. He did not get re-signed for the NFL. Michael Vick came out, not swinging, but just essentially said that if he had any advice for Colin, it would be for him to get a clean cut and to go back to focusing on playing good football rather than politics. Michael Vick was attacked by a bunch of people and he was referred to as an Uncle Tom or Coon. And Colin Kaepernick himself tweeted out a diagnosis for him saying that he had Stockholm syndrome. The insinuation being that he fell in love with his captors, he fell in love with the white people and he was grateful to the white people, which is why he was speaking out against or just giving him suggestions that would ultimately help his career. Getting a haircut and showing up to work without causing any drama is generally good advice. Colin Kaepernick was performing extremely well in the NFL until he decided that he was suddenly offended by the national anthem. I don't think there is a single job in America, whether you are white, black, Spanish, regardless of your race that you can show up in and consistently cause drama and you will not eventually just be ousted. Particularly in training the sports, people will actually participate and go to sports and spend a lot of money and spend $12 for a hot dog to tune out, to not be involved in politics, to just be involved in the emotion of the sport with absent any feelings or political affiliation. Bottom line I think that Michael Vick gave Colin some sound advice. But once again in the black community, when they see that they say, oh you're not one of us, you're one of them. We have to stop doing this because we need to evolve. We have to understand that showing up everywhere angry or showing up everywhere disappointed is not going to get us anywhere in the world or in society that we would like to be. There are a lot of things that I believe in personally that would make me either a coon or an uncle Tom. The first of them being that I don't support the Black Lives Matter movement whatsoever because the Black Lives Matter movement does not support me. I think that a better title for that movement would be Black Deaths Matter. They seem to protest, they seem to rage, and they seem to ruin and they seem to support violence when a black person dies. What about when a black person lives? There are tons of black people that are trying to better themselves in their community. There are tons of black people that are disadvantaged by the homes that they are born into and just not having money. These groups do not fund them. They will pay for somebody's funeral but they will not pay for somebody's college education. People that fund these movements like George Soros who has more money than God, who has the money to take people straight out of the projects and put them into white communities to fund their education and to fund them living in places that are better than the ones that are born refuses to do so. Instead, he encourages and he solicits black violence. He encourages us screaming in the street about Black Deaths and he therefore encourages us getting arrested, ruining our own records and making it impossible once again for us to thrive in society. I think that it is the most hypocritical movement on the planet and absolutely nothing to do with it. From a statistical standpoint, are black people being gunned down more often than white people? Absolutely not. The media will try to tell you so because there is more value in black people portraying this stereotype as angry than there is in you actually being educated and understanding the things that our community is actually facing as an enemy. One thing that is the biggest problem in the black community is our support which is so ironic when you think about the fact that we continually support these Democratic candidates. Our support of Planned Parenthood which has actually decreased the black population by 34%. Black babies are being slaughtered every single day and yet we stand behind the lines of the people that fund that. They fund a black massacre. There are no black voices standing up and saying this is wrong and if they do stand up and say it's wrong, they are dismissed as an uncle Tom. I'm happy to be an auntie Tom to tell you guys a little bit more about what our community needs to do to better themselves. Everything starts and ends with education. We cannot better ourselves unless we understand what it is that we are up against. Of course systematically black people were oppressed but of course you cannot just stick your hand out and ask for favors to get over that oppression. The most recent example of that, people that we can look to are the Jewish community. The Jewish community had the odds stacked against them after World War II. They were escaping Germany with the clothes on their back and look at where they are in the world right now. They did that by building a community that supported one another. There is no Jewish phrase for an uncle Tom. When somebody in their community made it and thought differently and made it a little further they encouraged that person and when that person got to the top they hired from the underground of their communities which is something that as black people we have to learn from. Absolutely. I do not remember the name of the person whose video I watched but he was an African-American leader similar to an Al Sharpton. He basically acknowledged the fact that no matter what you do for black people if you do not marry a black person then everything you did doesn't count and you are a traitor. People speak to you like this you need to turn off the TV. As a black community and as a black person I have dated within my race I did it outside of my race. Your highest priority as a human being should be to marry someone who thinks like you, to marry someone that will bring you the successes that you desire in your own life and to turn off the absolute garbage that tells you differently. That is the end of my Candice rant about why I do not support Black Lives Matter. Please stay tuned I will be putting out weekly videos. I guess the term nowadays is weekly vlogs and they will all be entitled The Myth of the Coons. Thank you guys so much for listening and they will all be entitled The Myth of the Coons."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_461", "transcript": "The black community in America, like many others, has a culture comprised of strong in-group preference. Despite things like this portionally high rate of black on black crime, there still exists a near universal mutual respect shared by black people for being black, even if it's not expressed explicitly. Because of that, racial betrayal is one of the most emotionally charged offenses within the black community, and titles for this offense range from Uncle Tom to Sambo to House Nigga and most commonly, Coon. Now I know a lot of right wing conservatively named blacks will argue that Coon is just a term used to silence blacks for wrong think. Others will probably argue that it's just another cancerous form of identity politics. And sometimes that is true, but not always. And while some people, black and non-black alike, may not recognize the concept of Coon to be legitimate, in the black community it is an established cultural axiom. In this video, I wanted to take a shot at explaining from the perspective of a black person what exactly makes someone guilty of being a Coon. Let's get started. First let's define our terms. Now there's a lot of different definitions for the word Coon. According to Urban Dictionary, a Coon is a black actor or actress who takes roles that stereotypically portrays black people, which I'm not sure is accurate because I find examples like character James Carter from Rush Hour who is the stereotypical black American sidekick to be hilarious. Or the boys of Summer from The Wire who play the role of stereotypical young black American men selling drugs. I love all these characters and to my knowledge they're all equally beloved by a majority of black demographics too. So I'm not sure if it's only Cooning when it's a stereotype that black people don't like or you know whatever. Another definition according to Webster is an insulting or contemptuous term for a black person. Again, while vaguely true, these definitions aren't really what I'm talking about. So since I couldn't find a definition that matches the context of which I'll be referring to the term throughout this video, I wouldn't head and wrote my own. In my opinion I think it's a sufficient definition of the word Coon as it's most commonly used by black people would be this. A black person displaying favoritism to non-black people usually white whilst collectively condemning their own race for not being more culturally identical to the race they favor. The reason I chose this definition is because the nature of Cooning isn't how many describe it. It's not merely acting white nor is it merely black on black criticism. Rather, Cooning is a sociological action, one that requires a conscious intent to subvert or defame black identity. We'll get into some examples of what I would say are reasonable perceived cases of Cooning in just a bit, but first let's talk about what Cooning is not. Oftentimes people misattribute Cooning to mean anything another black person does that they themselves don't like. And when people unreasonably use language it makes the meaning of the term pretty useless and the term Coon has been hella abused in this respect. For example, a black person having a romantic relationship with someone of another race is not inherently Cooning. Is it possible that they're doing so because they have insecurities about their own race, culture, etc. and want to distance themselves from their blackness? Sure. It's also possible that they have no issue with being black and the person accusing them of Cooning are themselves insecure and are projecting their emotions onto an innocent relationship. It's much more likely that you're just salty and bitter because they didn't choose you, but I ain't trying to hurt nobody's feelings. Another example of unreasonable use of the word Coon is the classic you talk white. If you're so stupid as to think that the adoption of proper English means that someone is pandering to whites, bruh. Being literate is not in opposition to black people or black culture. Other examples include claims that you know wearing your jeans weighs high makes you a Coon, straightening or coloring your hair makes you a Coon, not voting for Obama or Democrats makes you a Coon. I could go on and on with how stupid some of this shit can be and I've learned from experience that trying to reason with stupid people is more than often a waste of time so we're gonna leave it at that. While these are some of the dumbest examples of Coon accusations, they still fall under the definition outlined earlier, that being a perception of disloyalty to the black collective. But now let's talk about some other examples of Cooning which even I as a pretty solid individualist can understand being classified as such. Cooning from my experience seems to manifest itself in one of two forms, those being passive and aggressive. Passive Cooning is probably the most common, a good example of this phenomena would be CNN host Don Lemon. Now Don is someone who I'll criticize for a number of things. His mainstream leftist propaganda, his incessant whining about racism or his hilariously mediocre career as a journalist. I would love to spend more time with you. You are an incredible guy, thank you so much. What the hell did you bring me on the show for? I put you on the show to get you on to talk about your series, we talked for a long time. I know but we talked for a long time off the camera. The new show Mike Tyson mysteries airs every Monday night at 10.30 PM. Don Lemon's full of himself. I don't swim. Thank you Mike Tyson. Love bro. I love you too. But none of those things make him a Coon. Instead Don Lemon's Cooning stems from his appeals to improve the black community by whitewashing the culture. You see Don Lemon is his mainstream as mainstream blacks come. He's made a career out of assimilating into the milieu of white elites. And he's fared quite well as a result. Not only Lemon, but plenty of other black personalities. Charles Barkley, Ben Carson, Stacey Dash, Raven Simone, etc. The one thing all these guys have in common is an expressed favor of Eurocentric or mainstream American culture over black American culture. But I call it passive Cooning because the favor of white culture expressed by these individuals is, well, passive. And it isn't followed up with an explicit disparagement of black people or black culture, which is usually a tactic of aggressive Cooning. Unlike passive Cooning, aggressive Cooning is an act where a black person consciously divorces themselves from black culture. Again, in conjunction with the typical adoption of white American culture. A prime example of what could be perceived as aggressive Cooning would be Tree of Logic. Let me preface this by making clear that this isn't me taking shots and calling Tree of Coon. To my knowledge, we were cool until I randomly discovered she blocked me on Twitter. But that's besides the point. I'm only using Tree as a strategic illustration. It's not personal. So first, let me explain a little bit of background. Tree of Logic is a YouTuber whose channel somewhat overlaps with mine in that we're both black right wing YouTubers. Which is basically a niche category because there are so few of us. Anyway, myself and Tree both at one point had some pretty vocal alliances with the alt-right. As of late, I noticed we've both slowly begun to separate ourselves from the movement. Now I did so gradually in favor more so of promoting black capitalism and free association type stuff. Tree, however, seemed to do so at the blink of an eye after she got BTFO by Mike Enoch on the JQ. She decided to chimp out and retreat back to normie conservatism. Where I might add, she's now hyperactively shilling for Israel and non-racist white conservatives. Which is, you know, whatever. You do use this. Now that's the background. Here's how I believe she could be interpreted as a coon for this behavior. Tree of Logic has openly said that she allied with the alt-right only because she wanted to defend white people from the anti-white left. I have been a YouTuber for a year and a half now and during that time I have made 11 anti-black lives matter videos and four self-defense instructional videos encouraging and plating with white people to protect themselves and defend themselves against anti-white individuals. I have always been forthcoming about my quest to help keep white people the majority here in America and I have viciously fought against anti-white hatred. Now this is quite different from my reasons which were voluntary separatism and decentralization of culture. But that's fine. She saw white people as a group being bullied and wanted to defend them. Now she's doing so with the Jews. Okay, some could construe that as cooning, but there's really not enough evidence to accuse her of it. Unless you're one of those black people who think that any black person who's friendly towards white people is a coon. Or I could even be charitable and say that Tree's rush to white night for white people and Jews is more so due to her conservatism than anything. After all, I've also observed her to be dismissive of virtually any criticism towards police or Trump in what comes across as a dogmatic loyalty to blue lies matter and a boomer-tier mega fetish. It's possible she could just be dogmatically defending white people and Jews because of her politics, not her version to blacks. However, that's not all she believes. Tree of Logic also happens to hold heavy contempt towards the black community, not even necessarily certain elements within it, but the group as a whole. You see, she doesn't seek to disassociate with the entire white community just because she doesn't like the alt-right side of it. But as shown in this tweet, she's eager to disassociate from the black community as a whole, presumably due to her disdain for groups like Black Lives Matter. So if that's true, then I could see why one would come to the conclusion that she's a coon. Because she's displaying favoritism to non-black people whilst collectively condemning her own race for not being more culturally similar to the race she prefers. Aggressive cooning is by far an extreme rarity, not only because of the huge amounts of energy I suspect must go into impassioned countersignaling of the collective, but more so its social consequences in terms of a personal relationship to the culture. And this brings me to the final point I wanted to touch on, and that's the consequential result of being accused of being a coon. Most black Americans are natively settled in communities that have a distinctive blackness to them. Now this can be defined in a number of ways such as the food, the music, the behavioral norms, the language, etc. In essence, blackness is just a synonym for common culture. To be black genetically is not necessarily translative to being black culturally, or being accepted as part of the cultural in-group. I want to make sure this is understood because it's something that seems to be lost on many non-black people who object to the term coon. There's a real world relevance behind the meme of who gets invited to the cookout. Being of African descent doesn't necessarily mean you're entitled to a plate. In fact, a non-black person who is unequivocally removed from black culture is far more likely to be welcomed by the community than a black person who's a cultural outcast. But I think it is important to add that sometimes people who are black but don't really reflect black culture are incorrectly categorized as coons. And this is, for lack of better terms, problematic. Probably the most well-known synonym for coon is Uncle Tom. Now the term Uncle Tom originated from the book Uncle Tom's Cabin, where in the original writing he actually accepted being brutally beaten to death by his slave master because he refused to aggress against his fellow slaves or assist in their capture in order to do However, after the various film adaptations in the 1930s, the term Uncle Tom was repopularized to mean a slave who showed unconditional loyalty and servitude to the master. Theorically, an Uncle Tom would serve as the master's right hand nigger, you know, receiving special privileges, authority over other slaves, and increased compassion from the master relative to the treatment of other slaves that is. But another party who also received similar privileges and compassion were the house slaves. Now, house slave could sometimes be an Uncle Tom, but it wasn't an absolute. Oftentimes house slaves were chosen not merely because of their obedience to the plantation's hierarchy, but their fair skin, their attractiveness, and even secretive relations to the master. It wasn't terribly uncommon for the unclaimed children conceived between the whites and the slaves to be granted refuge from field work because of their familiar relation. Now, I know some of you are wondering why I went on this totally random tangent, but this is another important point that I failed to mention earlier in understanding what a coon by modern standards is not. Oftentimes people will call other blacks who are simply raised outside of black culture a coon. I actually recall back in middle school, we had a student join who had just moved from London. Let's call him D. Anyway, he was picked on pretty regularly. Regrettably, I was guilty of this as well. But he was teased and joned because he had a strong African British accent. He was pretty feminine, either gay or metrosexual. And he didn't really act black, you know, as most of the students knew it. Now, my school was 99% black consistently from elementary through high school, East Metro Atlanta. And as a result, the school was culturally homogenous. So when D. came, many people accused him of being a coon because you could tell he had a distinct European fashion sense. He had European vernacular and mannerisms, etc. But I think it's important to distinguish between a black person who favors white culture and projects that favoritism onto black communities, such as Don Lemon, from a black person who simply reflects the culture of which they were raised in, like D. A house slave who was merely raised around whites and has had white culture impressed upon them, isn't the same as an uncle Tom who consciously rejects and works to displace blackness. By the way, I'm not saying that black people who are raised in white dominant cultures are house slaves, it's just a metaphor. The reason I wanted to bring this up is because I want people to know that being labeled a coon isn't always a mundane thing. For people like me, it's whatever because I don't really value external opinions nearly as much as most people. Besides, most of the weirdos who call me coon are, you know, internet niggas talking shit over Twitter, most of the time white liberals. Guaranteed if any of them tried to accuse me of that shit within my Atlanta social circles, they'd be laughed out of the room. But for others, it can have some pretty impactful social ramifications. It's similar to being labeled a snitch in that regard, you know. It can dissolve social trust, evict you from established relationships, and in some extreme cases even put your safety at risk. Kind of like the effect of being labeled a Nazi or a white supremacist. While there are some legit Nazis out there, oftentimes the term is just a loaded smear campaign intended to silence or harm ideological opponents. And a lot of people unfortunately use coon in the same way. While in my opinion, the term does have a legitimate role in being used, it's much more common for it to just be weaponized by malicious people who don't like what you say or how you act. Anyway guys, that's going to do it for this video. There's no real solution to the malicious use of the word coon, but I think if more people, you know, really understand what the term means and you know, better understand how to use the language, it could be mitigated. And that's what I hope this video can serve as, you know, in the Black community, we have a unique language that for the most part is commonly understood. I think I've even seen it referred to as AF, African American vernacular English or Black English, whatever you want to call it. It's cultural communication. And I think it's important for us to better solidify the meaning and intended usage of these terms. Eventually, the repeated real world usage of the term will establish a sort of, you know, pseudo consensus. I just want to make this video anyway out of my own take explaining how I believe Black people should define the term. Let me know you guys' thoughts on this video in the comment section.

{"vid": "non_hate_video_465", "transcript": "Hello everybody Dylan here today and today we are going to be talking about how Keemstar is stupid. Man, this video is being released at the worst time for Keemstar. Now I didn't know this stuff was going to go down, I've been hearing rumors from people but I had no idea this organized attack on Keemstar was going to be happening. Now for those of you who do not know Keemstar is the host of drama alert. Yes, drama alert, that's who I'm attacking today. Now I have nothing wrong with the program, just the guy who runs it, Daniel Keem himself. Now I could be very generic and just play the Alex clip that everyone's heard a million times or I could do something way different so I decided to do a crossover with my friend the Angry Chimp and we are going to be pointing out the most wonderful parts of Keemstar. So we're going to start with Chimp then we're going to go to my parts. Hello primates, Angry Chimp here coming to you pre-recorded and highly edited from a room in the UK. Why have I got a tie on? I'm not fucking Donkey Kong. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, drama alert nation, I'm your host killer keemstar. Let's go right into the news. Daniel Keem or better known as Keemstar is the biggest shit stain on the underpants that is YouTube. He runs a little channel called Drama Alert and its sole purpose is to report drama and if there is none create himself by being a lying and deceitful nutsack. He will go out of his way to manipulate and even threaten other YouTubers just so he has something to report and in my opinion YouTube doesn't need a twat like this, he is a slimy cunt. But what do you think Dylan? Okay now on to my part. Now this part is going to be the exposing keemstar. Now I'm not going to be exposing keemstar for the normal stuff like the Alex clip, no. I'm going to be exposing keemstar for all the people he's personally destroyed. Now I'm not going to be talking about the elderly man who keemstar falsely exposed for being a pedophile because even the guy himself has said keemstar helped him out and he's grateful in the end. He knows it was an accident so I can't really hold it against him. But these are the people keemstar purposely attacked. So let's see what keemstar has been doing as of late. Okay now first is going to be keemstar vs pyro. Now in case you didn't know pyrocynical saw keemstar's video on tabuscus. Tabuscus was being accused of raping a girl. Now all pyrocynical said is that because keemstar didn't make it obvious enough that it was just allegations tabuscus was starting to get a bunch of hate on all of his channels. He said that keemstar should make it more clear that it's allegations. Other than that he was really nice to keem. And how did keem react? Well let me show you. Hey I got some youtube advice for you. Stop fucking copying people. How about that pyro? Stop copying people. Because if the type of videos that leafy makes becomes unpopular you're going to be left fucking opening up surprise eggs. You could contact me with that at any time. You didn't hit me up privately. You didn't share this opinion with me. No you make a fucking video criticizing me. Alright bro your fake piece of shit. And if you fucking swing at me I'm going to swing much harder back. And how the fuck does he keep saying that? Fuck what a tard. Did you really just say that I need to have a disclaimer saying that's an allegation? The title of the video is Toby Turner rape allegations. Alright? I still don't understand to this day why keemstar defended his tabuscus video so much. The entire video itself is literally a woman reading a tumblr post for 20 minutes while keemstar makes a bunch of different expressions in hopes that you don't click off the video because of how shit it is. Now this continued on for a little bit and everything was just okay. Keem was throwing some insults pyro was joking around and it was just minor youtube drama until keemstar started accusing pyro of messing around with an underage girl. Now he changed the age of this girl multiple times let me show you. Oh and pyro do you remember those youtubers that used to be friends with before he blew up and like fucked them off? You know how they've been contacting me saying that you've been dating some like 14 year old french girl and shit? Just please swing at me. If you're going to swing at me swing at me dude let me know because I got a fucking files on top of files to swing back at. Now if any of you didn't notice that he just deliberately lowered the age. Now originally this alleged girl was 15 and now keemstar has lowered the age to 14 probably to make it sound even more impacting and incriminating. And guess what later on stream he lowered the age again to say the girl was now 13 and on top of that basically insinuating that I was a pedophile. Pyro was trying to hook up with a 13 year old girl from France alright that he was technically like a pedo or weird or something right? But that wasn't enough. Keem had to keep digging. He offered people money they could figure out who pyro was and eventually it all worked out. Keem managed to find a photo of pyro and started sharing it on twitter comparing him to a lesbian and which just flat out sharing his face for everyone to see. Not only is this like the worst fucking thing you can do because pyro asked for people not to see his face but the fact that you're releasing his private information makes his flat out illegal. In the end you broke the law. Doxing is illegal. Pyro didn't want his info out there. Now keem defends himself by saying that this stuff was out online already but just like greyday said you should not be sharing this stuff. Pyro wanted to remain anonymous. He didn't want people to know what he looked like and you sharing his photo really helped get it out there. Other than calling pyro a furry that's about it so let's move on to the next person which is scarce. Now for a while there keem and scarce were good friends but that's how keem's like with everybody. He just waits for the moment to flip his shit and try to destroy people. And what did scarce do deserve this destroying? He partially chuckled when defending keem's daughter. Some people were threatening keem's daughter and scarce went on to defend her. And just because apparently I chuckled just a little bit just a little bit because it was uncomfortably chuckling because of how fucked up the entire situation was even though I was defending his daughter trying to help his daughter. Keemstar came back and made a video. He made multiple tweets and he did crazy shit. This is absolutely crazy. He's using his daughter as like a defense to basically attack me for no reason at all. I mean it's just it's crazy. I literally said I was on keemstar's side. I said that it was harassment. I said that it was fucked up. So me and keemstar actually ended up having a debate and during this debate he accidentally leaked my Skype. This was a big Skype that I had with a bunch of contacts on it. I was on really really big chats and stuff and I had I don't know like 200 contacts. So the fact that I have to add all those people back and obviously I got DDoS so many times because of this right. But it's not just that after the debate me and keemstar had he leaked my Skype again. And he did it this time intentionally. He intentionally leaked my Skype so hackers DDoSers just horrible people could get to my Skype and basically that Skype's fucking long gone. I mean that Skype's hacked and that Skype had some business contacts on it. That was another Skype that had even more contacts and I mean what the fuck was he doing man and then I got DDoS multiple times. My router almost got fried from him right. And the worst thing went down last night. This is the worst moment of harassment. He literally tweeted at me multiple times telling me he was going to come to my house. Now keep in mind he lives in Buffalo. I live in Long Island so he literally lives like I don't know seven eight hours away from me. He told me that he was going to drive to my house. Okay and he like was going and singing up with some videos of like him telling me like what are you going to do when I come to your house scarce. What are you going to do. I just want to know when I see scarce face to face when I come over to say hi and give him a high five you know is he going to laugh about what Nick said about my kid face to face. I don't think you're going to laugh then scarce. I don't I don't I don't think there's going to be any little chuckles. I don't think you're going to be on the defense train and be like oh I defended her I said it was wrong. Yeah right after you laugh bro you know you're supposed to be my friend all right supposed to be my friend you're not you're fake. I'm going to come say hi. I didn't fucking do anything bro like why do you want to come to my house and the worst part is is he didn't want to come to my house. He sent me the address of my parents house. I live in a dorm. He sent me the address of my parents house so he was going to fuck with my parents because I messed up on a tweet and accidentally you know chuckled even though I was defending his daughter nonstop in that video just because I uncomfortably chuckled at how fucked up the situation was he literally said he was going to come to my house and it's like oh my god. This went back and forth for a little bit but this is old info that's last year. Let's move on to something more recent. Now with these other ones you could say they somewhat deserved it if you were a messed up person. Pyro toxin stuff on Keem and scarce partially chuckled while defending Keem's daughter. This guy did something totally innocent. His name is Josh A and all he did was share a meme about Keemstar. And yes yes he was two years ago. Two years ago I was just trolling him and he responded and I thought that was really cool and then he helped me get partnered even though the partnering thing it gave me a 40-60 split of income and 10% of that went straight to Keem so I mean it wasn't really that much of a help. But anyways he calls me a bandwagon loser so then he tweets out my personal Skype information which also has my last name in it which anybody can just find my Facebook now and you know contact me or my family so it's fantastic Keem you know you really did a number on me. He wasn't saying anything serious about Keemstar it was a fucking meme we all share memes. Hell Keemstar himself is a meme. Look at his fucking beard it looks like Jafar out of fucking Aladdin. Arabian Niiiight in the Arabian days. So this guy shares a fucking meme about Keemstar and then fucking Keemstar leaks his information is this sounding really familiar? Gets him fucking docks this guy has to change his Skype stuff now he has to change his Facebook information because Keem just decided to be a total dick and release this shit. Now this guy does more videos on Keem and then Keem realizes that when he's being blown up with hate and this is during this bandwagon that's going on right now Keem tries to fucking buy him off he makes a sorry video for the guy and then he tries to fucking pay him to delete the video. And two after he apologized he DM'd me asking to have the video taken down I told him no because the video showcases what little faith I have left in humanity and like the fact that all these people would band together and support me while I expose this piece of shit for what he truly is and at the end I mentioned YouTube was also my job the video was doing really well not because of Keemstar but because of how big of a shit staying the guy is so I essentially told him no but because I mentioned money he offered to pay to have the video taken down which is truly a slimy thing to do. Fuck that shit Keem you are fucking pathetic trying to buy someone off and this isn't the first time Keem has tried to wave around money to get shit to go away. He's offering $5000 if you can find out what shit he talked on Grey Day Under A and Leafy is here about. He's offering $5000 so does it sound really that unlikely that he would offer to pay someone to delete videos about him? Hell he would probably do this to everybody if it wasn't for the fact he would have afraid of them exposing him. How much money do you think fucking Keemstar spends on popcorn? Must be a fucking ton. And for my last little bit of evidence to finally destroy Keemstar I'm digging up one personal. Keem accuses there by a pedophilia but little does he know that we all have information on him possibly being a pedophile. So I'm gonna bring up a little clip from Joey Salads. Now I don't agree with Joey Salads most of the time but this time he dug up something useful so let's play that clip. So I found out that on August 14th at night into August 15th on blog TV he made a 15 year old girl get naked and put papers on her private parts saying I love Keemstar. Here's the video. Unbelievable. I wonder if he's ever thought about turning his head on upside down. Fucking beard. So Keem you go around attacking multiple youtubers, you talk shit on people, you tell people that you can end their careers in a second, you try to bribe people, you leak people's personal information which is illegal and you had a 16 year old girl strip for you on a live stream while she was intoxicated. Aren't you a wonderful piece of shit? So hello John Willock nation. This is your host Killer Keemag. Let's get right into the yoke. In case you didn't know the fucking rat is being attacked. Go watch Great A's video if you want to on this. He's gonna be releasing a part 2 soon. Go watch Leafy's video on this and go watch Pyro's video on this. This is where I got all my clips from. So please support this. I would really love it if we could get Keem to stop being the host of Drama Alerts. I've said this before, Drama Alert is a good idea. It's the man hosting it. DJ Keemstar. That's the problem here. So Keemstar congratulations you are stupid. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. If you would like to see more of me then come stop by my channel the angry chimps show where I myself take a look at YouTube's weird and wonderful videos. I rant about random stuff and I like to get me groove on. Big thanks to Dylan Thomas for asking me to do this video with him. It was an absolute privilege. The chimp has spoken."}

I'd been out in the bush, and all of a sudden I heard the war drums of the Savage Yugomuga tribe. I was left to face a thousand savage savages alone. Yes. You know, nearly this sort of thing wouldn't bother me, but I had a little trouble with my trusty rifle. What to do, eh? Quick as a flash, I ran. I ran for three days and three nights through jungles across deserts, and I ran for three days and three nights through the jungle, and I ran for three days and three nights through the jungle, and I ran for three days and three nights through the jungle, I ran for three days and three nights through jungles across deserts over the mountains. Suddenly, I came to the brink of a huge waterfall. Just then, the savages broke from the jungle. I dived over the falls, implanting 5,000 feet. I disappeared beneath the surface of the water. Well, I'll wager those savages are still waiting for me to come up. You mean you didn't come back up? No, Radde. I went so deep that it was shorter to go right on through and come out in Australia. Commander, that story is out of this world. Quite."}

I don't you know I'm not into like third party controllers because like I got those cheapy Like the last time I you know when you buy a third party controller like 10 15 years ago It was for your friend to play when he comes over so you can beat him in every game because that controls suck so much Ah, it made you like 20% better in every game But the new ones now they're looking really good and that razor one looks really dope and it looks you know looks real deal It's thick. It's like you know looks dirty But yeah, it's like but I remember I had this my uncle at the time was living in America and I was in Greece and He sent me like a couple of controls and it's like you know in a game for Gamecube back in the day And so I got yeah have some like Gamecube controls. I got my god. Fuck you like they're wireless. He said wireless I'm like in my head. I'm like, oh holy shit. He got like two wave birds. I'm like fucking those are so fucking expensive They're fucking awesome, you know, he lives in America So like he's probably like you know loaded and he can send me this shit You probably found it cheap fuck it, you know some of that outlet I wait like two months in the mail I'm like, oh, this is gonna be so sick. I'm gonna get my wireless game who controls everyone's gonna be like whoa You got what is game controls and then the mail comes like, you know three months later And then we open it. I'm like fucking here. Well, it's controls work. I open it and some fucking shitty disgusting microscopic Like mad cats controllers with like a GameStop logo on them Holy fucking shit. I'd rather play with my imagination than with those controllers That was unbelievable. These those controls were unfucking believable. They were so trash Like that's like like I get the regular game controller My best friend gets the other game controller and then everybody else gets the two wireless controls And I just say you get the cool wireless ones and then I just know that I fucked them But you know, they'll find that in like they'll find that out in like five minutes, but you know until then Fucking enjoy your GameStop like wireless controllers, man. Fuck it. No, I was traumatized after those controls I never bought a third-party controller again. I was like now you can have them, but now Really cool the razor ones dope that one that you showed me dope like there's a cool Smash plays dude. I love him. I Fucking love smash dude like I used to play it that you know what they meant the minute they're back Not the issue with Smash was was that I was playing that game to death When there was no one else better than me to to compete with I was like the only guy at the GameCube in my whole island Everyone else had a PlayStation so when you show them smash, they had no idea what the fuck it was like Oh my god, it's like Tekken but with like Mario and shit. It's like oh my god This is a fucking crazy game. So like every time they would my friends would come over It would be like their first time playing so everyone plays like scrubs My boy you're in you're in the club dude join the Lost Souls dude and Yeah, like I would be absolutely Stomping them not because I was better is because no one could practice it to kick my ass So, you know when I thought I was all fucking good. I fly to Australia I come here and get my my ass handed to me like that. So here's your asshole Would you like it rare medium rare or well done and you know, then I never play smash again I was like, oh, there's all these like game breaking shit and wave dashing and all this shit And then you got like the NTSC version which is 60 frames a second and so much faster and blah blah blah And you know math plays differently and all this crap. I'm like I'm done. I'm too old for this shit I should have started 15 years ago. I'm too late. You know, it's like Just gonna press the button and Oh Yeah, take in a hundred percent can be compared to learning an instrument Yeah, big time. There's not there's no there's never a perfection New ways to play always being developed like, you know, you think that there's one way of doing stuff and this dude comes up and just Changes everything like, you know, completely changed the matter completely changes how instruments are played everything and it's all about grinding Taken that's why I think I always wanted to get into taken I just never did it but I always wanted it inside because it is like learning an instrument same shit You get you know instead of getting a move list you get a chord list you get a scale list You get all this bullshit theory. You have to do again and again and again and again You know in a dry way, it doesn't like it doesn't sound musical It doesn't look like you're fighting you just getting the mechanics in your hands the muscle memory the responsiveness I'm the fall back to when you're stressed out and Then when you like going out and playing Against bots is like jamming to like a drum machine. I imagine like you're given these rules you given these These perimeters and then you say okay, it's saying it seems like a real fight. It seems like a real performance but you're just testing out How you play under pressure like under the pressure of a bot or under the pressure of a metro and I'm keeping you in time the same idea and then you know fighting let's say Playing online is like jamming with your friends Which is you know not everyone's gonna play like a bot no one's gonna click like a drum machine, but they're gonna be on beat But and then I imagine like playing tournaments is like playing live It's when the shit that when the rubber hits the road when you know You fall back to your level of training where the nerves get to you and about how you deal with those nerves It's not about how good you are. It's about how good you are by the end of it It's like it's the same shit, dude. That's why I love it like I love the idea It's like this is it's just that it's just an electronic instrument. It's the same shit so yeah, I'm like super into like the way that The virtuosity in like playing taken is just this you know It's just as legitimate as anything else at the time it takes the amount of grinding the studying the frame studying frames is like fucking getting into jazz theory and like Like Baroque fucking counterpoint theory. It's like it's the same shit. It's just like really really nitpicky bullshit things That um, no most people are who gives a fuck but the guy who spends that time is Just gonna be stomping on these people for the rest of his life and they're gonna be like oh, he's just born that way He's broken. Oh, he's just exploiting shit like get fucked Put the time get rewarded and you know I've only been doing this like three days But you know I I do this kind of level of practicing and learning shit with everything I do like I do video production I do editing I do photography. I didn't get a degree in any of that shit But you know put the time in learn it as a sequence learn the theory do all that just take the steps one by one And then by the end of it, you know, you're just gonna you just gonna come out. Oh, wow Where'd you learn how to you know be a photographer? Where'd you learn how to edit? I'm like on YouTube and like Spending 12 hours a day for three months and not saying hi to anyone but then at the end of it seeming like you know what you're doing Like it's all about that. It's straight up Yeah Yeah, definitely the skill cap all that shit Yeah, take it in a nutshell ten more minutes. I've got ten more minutes"}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_511", "transcript": "On to begin though with a conservative radio host who calls the Zimmerman trial a sideshow. Larry Elder is the host of the Larry Elder show on KBC and also the author of Dear Father, Dear Son and he joins me now. Larry Elder, welcome to you. Welcome. Thank you very much for having me. I appreciate it. You've been pretty scathing about my interview with Rachel Gentel. Why? I was because you weren't doing her any favors by condescendingly trying to convince her that she's a victim. This is a young lady who didn't apply herself, a 19-year-old who's still in high school. Instead of saying young lady, take this as an opportunity to take stock of your life, you treated her like she was a victim. And that's how you're doing this whole thing about race and racism. 7,000 murders last year pierced of black people, almost all of them were committed by black people. Since Trayvon Martin has his unfortunate death, there have been 480 blacks killed in Chicago alone. 75% of those crimes have been unsolved. Where are the cameras? Where are the shows? It's outrageous to act as if Black America should fear some non-black guy's stalking some black kid at night. The likelihood of a black person being killed by a non-black person is extremely remote, which is why this became a big national issue in the first place, Pierce. Right. It's perfectly possible, as we have shown on this show many times, to be just as exercised by what is happening in Chicago, which is an absolute national disgrace to America, frankly, in terms of the outlandish guns. But you're not, Pierce. I am, actually. 7,000 murders last year. I don't think you watched my show, Larry. Wait a minute. Half of the crime... I don't think you watched my show. Half of the murders in this country are committed by black people, even though black people are 12% of the population, which means 6% of the population is committing almost half the murders. And you throw out the old people and the young people, Pierce, you're talking about 3% of the population committing almost 50% of the murders. This is why... The point I was going to make... ...common sense of people profile. Larry, if you just calm down for a moment, Larry. Here's the point I was going to make. I'm quite calm. I am... I'm just bothered by how you're handling all this. Larry, let me speak, Larry. It's nonsense. It's nonsense. Larry, I can just... Bleeding heart, liberal person. You think you're doing something for black people, you're not. You're making black people feel as if they're under siege. And it's not true. It's an outrage. Thank you, Larry. If I could just get a word in, that would be great. Here's my point. I completely agree with everything you're saying about Chicago. All right? Let's just get that on the table. I've been saying this repeated illness show. It's a disgrace what's happening in Chicago, particularly with all these young black teenagers killing other young black teenagers. And the president and people down have to deal with it. But let's get back to the Zimmerman trial. Let's get back to my interview with Rachel Gentel, because you tweeted some ridiculous things. You tweeted at one stage, would I like Rachel Gentel to fly my plane? Why would you say that? I'll tell you why I said that, Pierce. I'll tell you why I said that, because after you interviewed her, you condescendingly went on television the next morning and called her one smart cookie. Bull! Why don't you hire her as a nanny? Let's see how smart she is. It's a condescending kind of thing. You think she's stupid, Larry? To black people. I think you're stupid for saying that kind of thing to try to get black people to convince them. That wasn't my question. Race and racism remain the major problem in America when it doesn't. Do you think she's stupid, Larry? Race and racism are not a major problem in America anymore. The number one problem facing black people are the large number of black people born outside of Weblock. 75 percent. In 1965, five percent of all people in this country were born outside of Weblock. Fast forward, Pierce. The number now is 43 percent. You look at that for crime, dropouts, all that kind of stuff is connected. The other big problem facing black America, Pierce, is the economy. One in two black men does not have a job. And one of the heads of the Correctional Black Caucus once said, if a white person were in the White House, we'd be marching on the place because of the high unemployment. But we're talking about Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman, as if it's the number one problem facing black America. It is remotely on the top 10 list, Pierce. Okay, Larry. Larry, this isn't a sort of competition to see who can be the greatest filibuster in my show's history. I'm not trying to filibuster. I'm just trying to make some common sense. Let me just get back to the question I asked you and see if you can actually answer the question. Do you think that Rachel Gentel is stupid? I think that I would rather have a George Zimmerman living in my neighborhood and maybe if a George Zimmerman were living in my neighborhood, we'd have a few fewer Oreo castros. I thought we wanted people to be proactive. That wasn't the question, Larry. Say something. I know I'm answering something different that ought to be answered. Could you just answer my question? He's treating George Zimmerman like he's some sort of criminal. He's not a criminal. George Zimmerman shot dead and on a team major. He's a guy who cares about his neighborhood. He's a neighborhood watch guy. I don't you want people who are proactive? And there was crime in that neighborhood, Pierce. I live in South Central. There wasn't crime from Trayvon Martin in that neighborhood. The burglar bars are not on there because of George Zimmerman. They're on there because of the minority of thug in the community that's messing up everybody's image and reputation. This is why people profile. Instead of being angry at George Zimmerman, be angry at the minority of the thug who's committing these kinds of crimes. OK, if I could jump in again. So just to clarify, Trayvon Martin wasn't committing crimes in that neighborhood, was he? It was an unfortunate incident. Two people had preconceived notions about each other. It never should have been happened. Doesn't make George Zimmerman a criminal. I used to work in the DA's office, Pierce. I'm telling you, it was a dog case, a reasonable doubt case. Nobody I know would have filed the case. Yeah, well, we disagree, obviously, about that. I think it's completely wrong. Obviously. That George Zimmerman should get no punishment at all for killing an unarmed teenager. He's got serious punishment. He can't go anywhere. Are you kidding? He's a marked man. He's going to be sued civilly. He will never have a moment of peace. He killed somebody. Morally, he's got to deal with that, Pierce. He recognizes that. Well, Larry, I may respond. Do you recognize what he did? I may respond. Some people would say that he's got it easy compared to Trayvon Martin, who he killed. So much as people feel sorry for George Zimmerman not being able to lead the life perhaps he wished he could, at least he can lead a life. At least he can lead a life. I should have had a George Zimmerman in Cleveland and maybe already cast a little bit of a lie. I don't want George Zimmerman doing my neighborhood watch patrol. No, I don't. I don't. I've got three teenage sons, Larry. I don't feel comfortable having somebody like George Zimmerman marching around as some wannabe vigilante armed with a gun, potentially killing my kids as they come home from a store with a bag of Skittles and a can of soda. No, I don't. I don't feel comfortable. You live in a wealthy neighborhood, Gator community, plenty of security. You don't have to worry about that. Live in South Central. Come down to South Central sometime. See what's going on down there. They're not worried about George Zimmerman. They're not worried about Mark Furman. They're worried about the thug down the street coming from a single parent household. And that situation had been created by the left wing people like you who feel sorry for people and therefore you want government to take care of them. You think government is the way to help us in prosperity. Go to an Indian reservation sometime and see how they're lived. OK, Larry. Larry, I do feel sorry for some people. That is true. I wasn't aware that was a terrible offense. But let me get back to Rachel Gentel again, because you were very scathing. You were scathing. You were scathing. Larry, let me speak, Larry. Let me speak, Larry. You're scathing in the wrong things to do. If you're talking about, oh, I feel sorry for you. Oh, this person's a bigot. Oh, this person shouldn't have cross-examined you the way he did. Then all you're doing is creating a victim. You're telling Rachel Gentel that she shouldn't have to work hard. She shouldn't have to work on her addiction. She shouldn't have to improve her grammar. Just have her wave the flag of victimhood and she'll be perfectly OK. It is an outrage that the left has done to black people and you are part of this parade. Thank you, Larry. That's out of interest. How many languages do you speak? I don't speak Yvonics as well as Rachel. That's what you mean? No, how many languages do you speak was the question. And the relevance of that is what? You don't think she's a smart cookie. She speaks three languages fluently. How many do you speak? Oh, really? You think she's a smart cookie. So you want to bring it back to Rachel? That's not what we're talking about here. I think you've been. We're talking about how you got. I want to bring it back to Rachel, because that was why I'm going to. How you treat black people like children to whom the truth cannot be told. Rachel Gentile needs to get her act together. If my mother were alive, she would say, how dare she speak like that? Do you know her educational background, Larry? Well, that's in the third grade. I know how she presented herself on the jury. Larry, do you know her educational background or not? People evaluate you based on the way you express yourself. Larry, do you know her educational background? I'm incredible. So this young 19-year-old black woman that you are viscerating for her lack of intelligence, do you have any idea about her background? Why don't you hire her if she's so sharp as a co-host here? That wasn't the question, Larry. She's one smart cookie. Do you know her educational background? Yes or no? I know how she came across on the jury. That's all I need to know. That wasn't my question, Larry. Do you know anything? Why are you talking about this? Because I think it's relevant. Let me enlighten you, Larry. I book you to talk about Rachel Gentile. Let's talk about Rachel Gentile. Let's talk about women and white racists and even they don't know her for black America. It is not. You are implying that it is. It is not. As we speak, there's a guy in prison right now in Phoenix, a black guy in an SUV with his fiance, killed a Hispanic who cut in front of him. Larry. He was arrested right away. Had the Hispanic family not agitated, the guy may never have been arrested. Where are the cameras? Larry. If you have some white guy do something or some non-white guy do something to a black person, we want to march on Washington. Larry, let me just- It is outrageous. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Larry, thank you. If I could just bring you up to speed on Rachel Gentile, this woman that you think is so stupid. She actually suffered from- I didn't say stupid you did. She actually suffered. We checked this with her lawyer today before I interviewed you because this is why I booked you, of course. Even though you're trying to pretend now this is the last thing you want to talk about, that is why I booked you. Rachel Gentile when she was young at school, had a lot of time off school and fell behind because of illness. That was why she wasn't able to go to school. She was actually doing very well. She was at B grade at high school until her great friend, Trayvon Martin, was shot dead by George Zimmerman. She sounded you like somebody you want to hire in any kind of fashion. Her grades have since slipped to two-something because of the stress that she suffered, understandably from the death of her friend Trayvon. She's now been offered a chance by Tom Joyner and his people from his foundation to go to college. She wants to get those grades back up and make something of herself. Why would you- I think that's wonderful, Pierce. Why would you be so scathing about Rachel Gentile and so patronizing to a young woman who's clearly been through an appalling ordeal and who, when I interviewed her, I found to be a smart cookie, like I said. I found her to be fun and warm, engaging, street smart, and clearly from her educational background, no one near as stupid as you like to think she is. Once again, I never use the word stupid, you did. She was the most important witness in a murder trial. It was- She was standing between George Zimmerman and 30 years in jail and for you to act as if she was somehow abused by Don West, whose job was to make sure his client didn't go to jail, is outrageous. And as far as education is concerned, I applaud Mr. Joyner. He's done a lot of work in the Black community for education and I would recommend, Pierce, that we do something about the 50% dropout rate in the inner city and about the fact that President Obama opposes allowing parents to use vouchers to get their kids out of bad government schools and into a better school so they can have a possibility to get to the middle class. That's what we gotta be talking about here instead of some aberrant situation like George Zimmerman going to somebody that he thinks is suspicious and they have an exchange and there's an unfortunate death as if somehow that's some sort of indictment of America and Black people should look over their shoulders every night and act as if some white guy's gonna jump out of a bush and get them. It is outrageous. Hard work wins. Get an education. Don't pay attention to negative people and stay focused and you'll be okay in America. That's why most of the people in the world want to come here. That's why you want to come here, Pierce. Thank you, Larry Elder."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_515", "transcript": "Dr. Carrie Maday. She is a medical expert who has done research for decades and she has found some extremely disturbing things about the upcoming vaccine for COVID-19. Dr. Carrie Maday has been the medical director of two large clinics. She has a vast medical experience and we are honored to have her here. I want to encourage you to watch this video to the end so you can hear what she has to say. This may well be the most important video you will ever watch in your life. I am very excited to be here and I feel it's very urgent that we get this information out to everyone. I started researching vaccines probably in my early 20s, been very interested in them, but never before have I seen the technology being used on this proposed COVID-19 vaccine. First of all, this vaccine will be using a modified RNA or modified DNA in the vaccine. So why is this important? It's important to know because it could potentially alter our DNA, our genome. And what's the big deal about DNA or RNA? Well, our genome. Well, the genome is what makes us human, what separates us from the rest of the animals and plants in the world. It's the blueprint for what creates us, how we reproduce, how we function, how we repair, how we evolve. So one little change, one little protein inserted, one taken out, one changed can actually create a congenital defect or a hereditary disorder. So a little change is grand. So something that can alter that could really be devastating on us humans, right? So they're proposing to use this technology and part of this is called transfection. Okay. Transfection is the same technology being used to make a genetically modified organism such as a tomato or corn in the grocery store. And we all know that Monsanto is pretty well known for making genetically modified organisms. And they're not as healthy as the organic, the wild type that you see out in nature. So if this is the same technology being used on the plants, well, what would happen to us humans? Potentially, we would not be as healthy. Okay. And I want to remind everyone that this is the first time that it would be used on humans large scale. We would be the experiment. We would be the lab rats. We don't have long term studies. So this is very, very important to know. Let me just go and show you or tell you about one of the front runners for this vaccine. That is Moderna. Moderna has been given about $1 billion from the US government for research and development. It's backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. So they have a lot of money backing them. I wanted to let you know they're kind of the new kids on the block. They really have not been around for that long. They have never developed a human vaccine nor a human medicine ever. This is their first run at it. Also, just to know for you to know that they have gone from fast track their vaccine light years. Okay. So they went from a lab experiment to phase two, which is using only 45 human subjects in 63 days, two months. That's crazy. We should have years behind that. And I'm going to remind you that this is the first time they've ever developed a vaccine. Their early studies so far showed that their phase two, which is using 45 human subjects, when they did introduce this vaccine into the human subjects, 100% of the high dose vaccine group, 100% got systemic side effects. And the low dose vaccine group, 80% got systemic side effects. So already we're seeing initially side effects. Now long term, we don't know. So on Moderna, one of the ways that they could apply this would be a proposal would be going to use a bandage called a microneedle platform. So microneedle platform would be a bandage that you could get in the mail like Amazon or UPS. It's a bandage you would apply on your hand here. And then you take the sticker off and then voila, you have a vaccine. You do it yourself. So how are they doing this? The bandage has tiny little microneedles on it and it's designed after a snake fang or a viper fang. So it's like a bite from a snake, but many of them. And they say you really won't feel it, but it goes into your skin and the little tiny microneedles will be injected. So what's in a microneedle? It'll be either the DNA or the RNA vaccine. Number two, it'll be something called luciferase. Now this is very important to know they patented an enzyme called luciferase. Okay. So this is called luciferase. They claim because it gives a bioluminescence, a light. Okay. And it's not something you can see or feel. But if you have a special device like a smartphone app with a special application, you can scan over it and it will light up. It'll show a pattern, a digital code, a barcode, a tattoo. We're going to be branded. Each person will have their own ID. You know, this reminds me of World War II. You know, it's something to think about being branded like a product in the store. So that will be in there and that will hold proof that you're being vaccinated. They want to make sure that you're scanned and that you've gotten the vaccine. So we'll be branded. What could that be used for? Well, there's lots of technologies out there, but it's something that we need to be concerned about. So there's two things. We have a brand new experimental DNA or RNA vaccine that could potentially alter our genome. And number two, we're going to be tattooed or branded with an ID. And then number three, they'll be, this is all in a hydrogel. So hydrogel is a technology that was invented by DARPA, Department of Advanced Research Project Agency. Now, this is a small part of the Pentagon or the Department of Defense. They make the sci-fi inventions that you might hear about. So this is one of their inventions. You can look up on YouTube, hydrogel, the company Profusa and DARPA, and you'll see some clips of some of the technology of this. So this is a special technology because it goes under the skin. The body doesn't reject it and it has nanotechnology, which are microscopic robotic organisms. So these microscopic organisms that are robotic will be in your body. They can assemble, disassemble and reassemble and to do innumerable things into the body. So the idea of this would be it's a way for it to gather information from your body. So you could get your blood pressure, your blood sugar, your heart rate, which sounds good. Gather that information. However, it also has a potential to be used for other things. It can gather how many steps you've taken if you've fallen. If you're swimming, if you're running, if you're menstruating, how your menstrual cycle goes, if you're having sex, if you're sleeping, it actually has a potential to know your emotions. All of this data, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year is being accumulated. And where is it going? While they claim it goes to a smart app like your phone, the iCloud or any smart device, but who's getting this information? Who is using it? What are they using it for? That has not been answered. So the other important thing to know is they're gathering all this information about us. And we're putting that out. So we're being connected to artificial intelligence. You have to know this is not just a vaccine. We're being connected to artificial intelligence. So just like a phone, you have your smartphone. You can send a text, you can send an email, but then the phone or someone else can send something back to you, to your phone. That means something can send something back to your body. Messages or information. What could happen from that? I could imagine that you could be affected with your mood or your behavior, your memory. That could really cause a lot of problems, a lot of confusion. And who's in charge of this? The Department of Defense, Bill and Melinda Gates, who's doing this? We don't have answers yet, but this is something real to know. This is being proposed. And I don't know if you've heard of something called ID 2020, but it's also the idea that everybody will have a unique identifier. And from that identifier, everything will happen. We will not need credit cards. We won't need cash. Well, this is the beginning of the unique identifier, this branding, this tattoo. This means the end of cash, the end of credit cards. This is the beginning of all of this, okay? The loss of autonomy, the loss of independence, the loss of privacy. We have to really know what these people are intending to do. So the Hydrogel also, the companies are claiming that the Hydrogel has a potential to be an on-demand drug delivery system, okay? And I'm not saying it's coming in this vaccine, but I'm saying this is the same technology. You need to know this. So an on-demand drug delivery, that means that through a light application that a drug could be delivered into your body. Well, that's a little concerning because I know if I take a medicine, I have a tablet and a bottle that has a label. I see the tablet and it has a unique identifier on the tablet. And I take it and I know when I take it, I'm in control. But what if something, it has a light source, and I'm not quite sure what they mean by that, but that is what they're talking about, can activate something in your body. What if you don't know it's been activated? What if there's a problem with it? I mean, could you imagine the implications of this? What if a bunch of people are rioting out of control? Could something be stimulated in you to sedate you? I can imagine in the wrong hands this could be very dangerous. Is that part of the reason of our military being involved? I'm just giving you some ideas to be critical thinkers and to know what they're proposing in these vaccines and to research these things for yourself. You really have to know how it's not just a vaccine they're giving us. They're manipulating our DNA, our genome. And, you know, they say it's temporary, but I'm telling you that when you manipulate the genome with transfection, you can make it permanent. It is a possibility. And they won't know that until they do it to all of us. Do you want to take that chance? you"}

In spite of Russian support for Syria and a long history of tense adversarial relations, Israel and Russia are close geopolitical allies. So why exactly do the two countries love each other? Well, the political and social history of Russia and Israel is actually incredibly unique. Early on in Israel's formation, the Soviet Union was a major supporter of a Jewish state. Allegedly, Russian dictator Joseph Stalin expected the new country to be socialist, and the USSR was even the second country in the world to recognize Israeli sovereignty after the United States. However, this support was not long lasting. In an effort to gain control over the Middle East, Russia funded and armed countries like Syria, Iraq, Libya, Egypt and others. Meanwhile, the United States provided military and financial support to Israel, creating a de facto adversary to the Soviet Union. And yet, in spite of their political divide, the people of Israel and Russia have seen parallel social development. Due to the Soviet Union's persecution of religion, and in particular the country's state-sanctioned anti-Semitism, Israel served as a welcoming home for Jewish Russians, known as Refuseniks. In 1970, a group of Refuseniks attempted to hijack an airplane in order to escape the Soviet Union. And while they failed, it drew international attention to the fact that conditions within Russia were terrible, and those who wanted to leave weren't allowed to. So throughout the 1970s, Russia allowed hundreds of thousands of Jewish Russians to leave the country, and by 1988 an estimated 160,000 had emigrated to Israel. This mass migration of Jews was known as the 1970 Aliyah. Once in Israel, Russians were able to assimilate while introducing their own social norms, including a focus on high culture, such as theater, literature, music and art. In the Soviet Union's last leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, opened the country's borders, a second massive wave of Russian Jews came to Israel, close to one million over the following decade and a half. There are now more Russian Jews living in Israel than there are in Russia, and Russia is the largest source of international Jews in Israel. This enormous domestic influence of both Jewish culture in Russia and Russian culture in Israel may be the reason that both countries are incredibly sympathetic to each other, in spite of their international disagreements. In the early 2000s, the two populations elected leaders who were outspoken supporters of each other, Russia's Vladimir Putin and Israel's Ariel Sharon. Israel's current Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, himself has family roots in the former Russian Empire. For the past decade, much of Israel's ability to maintain both their sovereignty and avoiding international sanctions has stemmed from broad and equal support from both of the world's 20th century superpowers, the United States and Russia. In fact, the US and Russia, in addition to the United Nations and the European Union, make up the Middle East Quartet, which is a collection of national bodies working to solve the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. On the one hand, Russia has been working to support the Syrian regime, which has repeatedly attempted to destroy Israel. Meanwhile, Israel stands opposed to Iran, Russia's longtime ally. And yet, the two countries have cultures and politics that are so deeply intertwined that their social bond is able to overcome any military divisiveness. Iran and Israel have been opposed for decades. To learn about why the two hate each other, despite sharing allies, watch this video right here. Thanks for checking out NowThis World.

CNN's Renee Marr spoke to Amari Allen and her family about what happened. 12 year old 6th grader Amari Allen is healing after she says three white male classmates at Emanuel Christian School in Springfield, Virginia targeted and attacked her because of her hair. I was about to go down one of the sides when three boys came up to me like, sorrows me, and they put me on the ground. One of them put my hands on my back, one put their hands over my mouth, and one cut my hair. The alleged attack on school grounds was both physical and verbal. I was saying like, my hair was ugly, it was nappy. I was saying that I don't deserve to live, I shouldn't have been born. The back of it was in the middle of her back, and they cut all of these. Her grandmother says she was targeted for being different. They attacked her as whom God created her to be, as a young lady of color. Amari says it was the school bell that saved her when it rang. I mean, I was laughing when it's back to the line, and I just got myself up and went back to the line. It started the first day of school when they started taking her lunch and eating her lunch in front of her, telling her these nasty words, you're not fit to live. Yeah, you're not fit to live. You're ugly, your hair is nappy, you don't belong here. The school told CNN in a statement, we take seriously the emotional and physical well being of all of our students and have a zero tolerance policy for any kind of bullying or abuse. The student body there is 52% white and 11% African American. Emanuel Christian made news earlier this year because second lady Karen Pence teaches art part time there, despite a school policy that bans gay students and parents. Pence's office defended her decision to work there. The Allen family filed a police report and the Fairfax County Police Department tells CNN they are now investigating. You realize that you are beautiful, right? And you realize that your hair is beautiful too, right? In the meantime, Amari's family says they are reminding her daily that she is enough, trying to reverse the negative impact of the painful words from her classmates. We used to say sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never hurt. Words will kill. There's a lot of people today that have committed suicide over one word, so words have deep scarring. Well, Amari missed a few days of school as a result of this incident, but she plans to return and the school told CNN those involved in the incident will be out of school while police continue their investigation. Now the family says that they do forgive these students, but they want to see them receive some sort of punishment and counseling so that they never do this to anyone else again.

{"vid": "non_hate_video_530", "transcript": "Well, we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covet means for expanding its sphere of influence, on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It's backed by Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, NASA and the CIA. Each one costs $10 million and operates at 459 degrees below zero. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. They call it the Infinity Machine, quantum computing. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. If you go all the way back to Norwood Weiner, the goal of creating artificial intelligence was to create an all-seeing eye, a global computer that sees all, sees everything and to become gods. And the sentient world simulation, SWS, went live in 2007. Right now, we're inside a computer program. Isn't really so hard to believe. These nanobots, these blood cell-sized devices, will be going in our bodies. We'll have some go inside our brains through the capillaries, non-invasively. They'll be interacting with our biological neurons. They'll put our brains on the internet. And they'll also enable us to enter a virtual reality environment from within the nervous system. So if we want to go into a virtual reality environment, the nanobots will shut down the signals coming from our real eyes and our real skin and create the signals that would be appropriate for the virtual environment. And then it'll feel like I'm in that environment. This... This isn't real. What is real? How do you define real? If you're talking about what you can feel, what you can smell, what you can taste and see, then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain. If we have algorithms that stimulate the right things and give it the right data, they could reprogram you in a way without you even knowing it. We call it hallucinating, right? But these would be controlled hallucinations run by algorithms. So you think you're in control of your own will, but it's actually some evil AI or evil people controlling everything we do and we're more like zombies, you know? Like we think we're free and we're not actually free. It is called the Sentient World Simulation. The program's aim, according to its creator, is to be a continuously running, continually updated mirror model of the entire planet, complete with billions of nodes representing every person on the Earth. Targets and mind control victims have their minds linked up for life with conscious supercomputers, which send a steady stream of bi-directional, low-frequency electromagnetic radiation to the targets for... And what people have to realize is that these targeted individuals are basically the test stage for ruling all of this madness out to all seven billion of us on this planet. And this was a white paper put out by Purdue University in 2006 and the Sentient World Simulation, SWS, went live in 2007, which represents every person on the planet within this computer matrix as a node and every node is given an avatar and identifier. And that is real-time 24-7 monitoring of every person on the planet. This is primarily, but not exclusively, facilitated by the adiabatic quantum computers produced by D-Wave Corporation. At the time of initial reports on the program, there were only 62 country-level simulations being run by the U.S. Department of Defense. These simulations grouped humans into composites, with 100 individuals acting as a single node. But already at that time, the U.S. Army had used the systems to create a one-to-one-level simulation of potential army recruits. It's the stuff of a Hollywood movie, but a group of veterans has filed a lawsuit against the CIA and U.S. Army claiming that the government planted remote-controlled devices in their brains. The claims relate to a government program at the U.S. Army's Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland. The ultimate aim would be to archive enough data on each individual to be able to make a computer model of everyone on the planet. The human genome, we have a finite in the hundreds of thousands of different genes across our species. And we mapped them out in the human gene project. Well, now it's the human mind project, the global brain project. President Obama just recently funded a whole bunch of scientists to decipher the mind. Well, our previous president, same thing. George Bush said the same thing. They're trying to decipher every possible thought and uniqueness due to culture and language and what not. And the goal is to make a cognitive model or map of the victim's brain. Ultimately, the system replicates and digitizes the will, intellect and emotions, the soul of the targets, and downloads this back into the conscious computer. Robots the smartest people. Artificial intelligence, AI. The idea is to port the software from the human brain. First, we're going to need lots of cheap, fast, parallel computers. He was referring to parallel processors about servers. What he did not state was that it is actually the quantum computer systems coming out of D-Wave that actually creates and drives this new matrix known as the SWS. It is not transistor-based servers that run this. They are qubits, quantum bits. It is the SWS and D-Wave that comprises this new matrix. Second, we're going to need to scan individual human brains and find spatial and chemical detail to see exactly what cells are where, connected of what, or what type. We could scan my brain from inside, send it to the bloodstream, billions of them in the form of nanorobots or nanobots, and capture every detail of my synapses and neurotransmitters and create a virtual Ray Kurzweil and a very powerful computer. And it would be indistinguishable from me. It would pass a Ray Kurzweil Turing test. And third, we're going to need computer models about each kind of brain cell works, taking input signals, changing interval state, and sending output signals. We have good enough models of all the kinds of brain cells and a good enough model of brain. We can put it together to make a good enough model of an entire brain, and that model would have the same input output behavior as the original. So if you talk to it, it might talk back. If you ask it to do things, it might do them. If we could do that, everything would change. The Manhattan Project gave us the atomic bomb. The Genome Project gave us the human genome. The third great initiative could be the Connectome Project. To map the entire human brain. And that may take a quantum computer. Okay, the first thing I can tell you is that M has spent most of their life in virtual reality. While this is what you would look like in virtual reality, this is what an M would look like in virtual reality. It's computer hardware sitting in a server rack somewhere. But still, it could see and experience the same thing. But some things are different for M's. M can make archive copies, and with enough redundant archives, an M can be immortal, in principle, though not usually in practice. And an M can move its brain, the computer that represents its brain, from one physical location to another. M's can actually move around the world at the speed of light. And by moving to a new location, they can interact more quickly with M's near that new location. Emulation is really what we talk about in the SWS as the nodes, the avatars. Two single person on the planet, okay, out of Purdue University's own paper in 2006. Every person is assigned a avatar. They're represented computationally in the AI system that drives the SWS as a computer node that they're given an avatar marker. Take the avatar and hang the word emulation on it. In other words, they've been tracking us. They've been reproducing us. We're reproducing our metadata for years. We can model every single atom, every single molecule with a three-dimensional structure in every single brain. They claim they've modeled the personality of every adult in the United States, 230 million people. And SCL, the Mothership Group, they do work in any number of countries. They're involved in politics in many countries. They put together a micro shot personality assessment for everyone. M's are very much like humans, but they are not like the typical human. The typical M is a copy of the few hundred most productive humans. If you construct a model of the human brain, you can then plug people into this hive mind. You could, as an intermediate step, take these duplicated neurons, artificial warm and wet cubits, as I call them, and you can integrate those into an actual human mind. Thus, you are able to control that human mind with artificial neurons and then have those minds connected to each other, just like you network in daisy chain computer systems. That is the hive mind. And this means that in the future, communications could be done mentally. What I'm saying is that the internet will be replaced by brainnet. They control the mind the same way that they teach the AI computer systems at the high level of AI. We're not talking about cars and trains and planes and automobiles. They were talking about AI that is so sophisticated that it operates the sentient world simulation so sophisticated that it actually taps in and controls the mind. And Google was the primary interested party that pulled this whole thing together. What they're going to do is apply this machine to an area that I think is fundamentally important. It's a crux of our future as humans. And that's, can we build machines like us? We can model every single atom, every single molecule with a three dimensional structure in your entire brain. That level of precision will keep advancing to the point where it's absolutely indistinguishable even at the very microscopic levels. You could recreate an entity that's, even if you looked inside of it, its simulated brain would be processing information just the way I do. If you start looking at quantum computing and where it's going, it's pretty freaky sort of stuff. And thinking about the world as an electrical universe and the fact that we are energetic, electrical beings, that's how we work. Everything is electrical. Every signal that runs through our body is electricity. Everything, every thought we have, everything we feel, every touch, everything we speak, it's all the result of electromagnetic signals floating around our body, impulses that come from our heart, from our brain, the way we feel a bench when we touch it. This is an electrical signal that's sent to your brain that tells you what the bench feels like. So it's all electromagnetic. It's all firing of electromagnetism through our synapses and all this sort of stuff. The adiabatic quantum computer is linked to 7 billion human brains. It is now in its own language of cryptology able to function independent of any oversight throughout the world with its own form of communication, its own form of code. And it is able to link everyone on the planet at this point. We can model every single atom, every single molecule with a three-dimensional structure in every single brain. They claim they've modeled the personality of every adult in the United States, 230 million people. And SCL, the Mothership Group, they do work in any number of countries. They're involved in politics in many countries. They put together a micro-shot personality assessment for everyone. What I am principally is not this material stuff but a pattern of information. Well then if the pattern is the essence and if you copy the pattern to whatever level of precision you need, then that copy that has the exact same pattern should be me. They're running everything that's happening in society parallel and they've got a little dot in their matrix for everybody. This is a game society. They know where it's been, they know where it's going and they know where it's going because they're steering people into the direction it wants to go. There are an enormous number, mind-bogglingly large number, of parallel realities as real as this one that have different consistent histories. So imagine a world where all of the laws of physics as we know them are obeyed but different decisions were made along the way. Different decisions at the level of tiny microscopic particles, different decisions all the way up to what you just chose to eat for lunch and whether you chose to come to the session or not. This is an article from 10 years ago. Sentient world, war games on the grandest scale. The VOD is developing a parallel to planet Earth with billions of individual nodes to reflect every man, woman and child, this side of the dividing line between reality and AR. It's absolutely indistinguishable even at the very microscopic levels. You could recreate an entity that's, even if you looked inside of it, its simulated brain would be processing information just the way I do. Deep state has merged the quantum computer with the sentient world simulation and the true reason for all this data collection is to feed it into this AI machine to predict and manipulate the course of humanity. Their ability to look at data in a quantum artificial intelligence manner, it's just going to be an unstoppable monster. And this is bizarre because we don't see those other things. But science has reached the point now where we can build machines that exploit those other worlds. So Google was set up 18, 19 years ago to build a giant artificial supercomputer based on the neuron activities of the hive mind of humanity with billions of people wired into it with the Internet of Science. And so all of our thoughts go into it. And yes, they're in the cloud, but it's actually encrypted and kept private for you and we do a pretty good job with that. And we're actually building a computer that has real neurons in real time that's also psychically connected to us that are organic creatures. You are connected as an organic computer. I mean, this is one of the most quote unquote, conspiratory theories that's been around for many, many, many, many years, decades. The reality is, is we're now facing the reality of that. It is no longer a conspiracy and quite frankly, a terror. Even now, the sentient world simulation is watching you learn about it. And inside its intelligent mind is creating a second view, running different scenarios against you to see how you react."}

He was a little teenager, a Shabbat goi. So he spoke Yiddish. He spoke Yiddish. So he grew up in that, and he was an art jury, was a great speaker and all the rest. And he had a love for the idea of the Jewish state in what was then called Palestine. So when he was older and he went to Congress, this was one of his big issues. He worshipped at the Shrine of Franklin Roosevelt. He was a New Deal Democrat. He worshipped at the Shrine of Franklin Roosevelt. But he disagreed with him on two very strong points. One was on the treatment of Jewish people in Europe that he wanted to call more attention to. And two, okay? He, the second was the establishment of a Jewish state in what was then known as Palestine. He was part of something called the Berksing Group. Now some of you know this, some of you, Marylanders, and we've had shared this thought at other times. And I just want you to know that this support for U.S.-Israel relationship is kind of in the DNA of our family, even before the establishment of the state of Israel. He went on to become the mayor of Baltimore and support all of that. My brother would become the mayor of Baltimore, and he supported the state of Israel and U.S.-Israel relationship as well, and has, they say, stadium, I don't know if that means playing field, whatever, in Haifa, named for him Thomas D'Alessandro III. But one of the things that I think is so remarkable as I look back at my father, part of this Berksing Group that went around, they had pageants and parades and rallies. And here he was, this auditor speaking in Yiddish about the cause. When he was on the floor of Congress in June 22nd, 1942, he rose to speak about the state of Israel, and he said, Mr. Speaker, as a member of the committee for a Jewish army, I speak to you on behalf of 200,000 fighting men who, by divine destiny, then he goes on to say that they are fighting for the establishment of the state of Israel. So this was really a big deal for all of us. So while I do not have, cannot boast of Jewish grandparents, as other speakers have and will and how fortunate they are, I do have my father's devotion and my brother's devotion to the cause, which is part of our family tradition. And I do have to boast of my Jewish grandchildren. I think I have the most of anyone in Congress. I'm not quite sure. But they're adorable. You might expect me to say. The U.S.-Israel partnership, let's hear it for my grandchildren."}

Wait a second, it takes one hour to build a batch of cookies, and you have 15 ovens, probably in four different kitchens, right, doing 24 hours a day for five years, how long would it take to get to six million?

{"vid": "non_hate_video_533", "transcript": "Thousands of government-sponsored experiments did take place at hospitals, universities, and military bases around our nation. The goal was to understand the effects of radiation exposure on the human body. While most of the tests were ethical by any standards, some were unethical, not only by today's standards, but by the standards of the time in which they were conducted. They failed both the tests of our national values and the tests of humanity. The breathtaking advances in science and technology demand that we always keep our ethical watch-like burning. No matter how rapid the pace of change, it can never outrun our core convictions. Informed consent means your doctor tells you the risk of the treatment you are about to undergo. In too many cases, informed consent was withheld. Americans were kept in the dark about the effects of what was being done to them. The deception extended beyond the test subjects themselves to encompass their families and the American people as a whole. But these experiments were kept secret. Do you know why they've got my team decoding the entirety of human thought? Yeah, so I can tweet without a keyboard. Implanting. That's the end game. The power to implant thoughts into a person, a group, an entire population. The sell it to the world is the power to communicate, and then they'll have complete power to control. The CIA won't need to stage a coup to rig an election across the planet. Hell, they could turn any one of us into an undercover assassin whenever they wanted, and they would do it all from a computer in a lab right here. Matthew's lying. We've been testing on humans for months. They were stuck and we just unlocked it all for them. It's too much power. Is this work? Everything that we're doing, this is the end of freedom. The movie The Matrix was just a tale of science fiction, yes, but it is beginning to look more like a documentary every day. Now some may scoff at this idea and say, you're just fear mongering. It's not going to happen. You conspiracy theory nut. Well, I may be a nut, but there is no conspiracy when the information is made public to you. That's just you not being aware of it. So we are going to take a closer look at this, because right now something is happening that you may not be aware of. A sentient simulation of our world in real time. No, this is not a video game, folks, but for those who think it is, I have a question. Are you ready, player one? The true control grid is this technology, voice to skull, hive mind, behavior manipulation technology, and it can all be done remotely. But they have a division focused solely on developing the technology for use by the military, government agencies, law enforcement agencies, and foreign government. This technology at that point when it is nationwide will be used by automated computer, super computer software program that will manipulate the emotions and behaviors and thoughts of everybody in the United States of America, and it can all be done remotely. It sounds so futuristic. It sounds crazy, like video phone call or pocket sized computers or the government watching all of it all the time. Guess what people? The future is here. There is a very real risk that you are going to become a full blown 24 seven targeted individual. You might want to start watching what you think. I understand. Extensive information gathering on every American. Human experiments with drugs and psychosurgery. Electronic surveillance. The era of the computer. Inpatient privacy. Growing government and corporate power over our lives. A people plagued by dehumanization, loneliness, and violence. Pneumatic? Perhaps. But we are losing control of our technology and our lives. You asked why I picked you. I didn't. You did. The surveillance you've experienced means you've been selected. A term which will mean more to you as you learn about how the modern SIGN system works. For now, know that everybody you cross, every purchase you make, every call you die on, every cell phone tower you pass, friend you keep, article you write, site you visit, subject you type, and packet you route is in the hands of a system whose reach is unlimited but whose safeguards are not. Your victimization by the NSA system means that you are well aware of the threat that unrestricted secret police pose for democracies. This is a story few but you can tell. Apparently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings. This is the story of a 30-year search by U.S. intelligence agencies to perfect mind control. Some of those engaged in that search have agreed to talk about it for the first time. One said, I think every last one of us felt sorry to attempt this kind of thing. We knew we were crossing the line. The search would be endless. From brothels, an agent says, we learned a lot about human nature in the bedroom. To the mystical rites of a magical mushroom ceremony performed by an Indian shaman. To a Spanish bull rig, the bull has had electrodes implanted in the brain and is controlled by a scientist. There would be victims. One intelligence agency tried to peel this man's mind back to reveal its deepest secret. The bull has been controlled by a scientist. One intelligence agency tried to peel this man's mind back to reveal its deepest secrets. I have the truth. This man worked on some of these programs. He would write of his work, it was fun, fun, fun. This is the story of the search for mind control. ABC News, close up. Mission, mind control. The reason I keep coming back to MKUltra and its surrounding programs is because the more I research, the more I realize that we are living in the very product of that program today. The harder you look around, the more obvious it will become that the public wasn't told anything about the real aims and objectives of the CIA's. Really, they call it a mind control research program, but it was really just a control research program. Mind, behavior, individual, society, global. And when the revelations came out in the 70s, they dazzled the public with tales of Manchurian candidates and spy versus spy, and Korean brainwashing techniques, and they purposefully flown all their dirty laundry around. Solacious tales of prostitute halfway houses and LSD being administered to unwitting people just to see what would happen. But the whole revelation of the MKUltra program is pretty much a joke. It would take over 100 books and dozens upon dozens of documents to spell it all out for you in minute detail, but the technocratic cybernetic New World Order that's unfolding all around us right now has always been about total world domination. And it connects to every other conspiracy you can possibly think of. And when you really start to research just what's been declassified, just the information that's out there, when you read the documents yourselves and you start really looking through the books and the writings of some of these people, and you realize all of this, it's pretty clear that this is one of the biggest threats that we actually face today. Behind all the stuff they tell you in the media, behind all the other stuff that's going on that they flash in front of your face to distract you, this is a serious situation. 2013 to 2014, new centers working on cybernetic technologies for the development of radical life extension Rise. The race for immortality starts. 2015 to 2020, the Avatar is created, a robotic human copy controlled by Thought via brain computer interface. It becomes as popular as a car. In Russia and in the world appear, in testing mode, several breakthrough projects. Android robots to replace people in manufacturing tasks. Android robot servants for every home. Thought controlled avatars to provide telepresence in any place in the world and abolish the need for business trips. Flying cars, thought driven mobile communications built into the body or sprayed onto the skin. 2020 to 2025, an autonomous system providing life support for the brain and allowing it interaction with the environment is created. The brain is transplanted into an Avatar B. With Avatar B, man receives new, expanded life. 2025, the new generation of avatars provides complete transmission of sensations from all five sensory robot organs to the operator. 2030 to 2035, rebrain. The colossal project of brain reverse engineering is implemented. World science comes very close to understanding the principles of consciousness. 2035, the first successful attempt to transfer one's personality to an alternative carrier. The epoch of cybernetic immortality begins. 2040 to 2050, bodies made of nanorobots that can take any shape arise alongside hologram bodies. 2045 to 2050, drastic changes in social structure and in scientific and technological development. All the prerequisites for space expansion are established. For the man of the future, war and violence are unacceptable. The main priority of his development is spiritual self-improvement. A new era dawns. The era of Neo-humanity. A group of scientists say we are closer than ever to creating technology which can emerge with human biology in order to access the cloud in real time. Confused? Well, Archie's Rachel Blevins is here and has all the details. Can you imagine technology that is so advanced it could provide you with instant access to the world's knowledge and artificial intelligence as soon as you think of a specific topic? Neural nanobobotics may be developed to enable a safe, secure, instantaneous real time interface between the human brain and both biological and non-biological computing systems. This level of technology could include brain-to-brain interfaces, brain-to-computer interfaces, and specifically brain-to-cloud interfaces. Technology linking the brain to the cloud could drastically alter the state of communications between humans and machines. So in order for this to become possible, the study noted that data transfer between living human brains and the cloud would likely require the use of supercomputers with artificial intelligence algorithms. The senior author of the study noted that once inside the brain, the devices would then wirelessly transmit encoded information to and from a cloud-based supercomputer network for real time brain state monitoring and data extraction. The connections will start to be made between artificial intelligence and the human brain. And the human brain will be connected to what he calls the cloud. Another name for this is the smart grid, basically to artificial intelligence. As time passes, artificial intelligence will be more and more of human thinking and human perception until basically it's the totality of human thinking and human perception. At which point we won't be human anymore in terms of the consciousness processes we are using today. We will be artificial intelligence. And this is the assimilation I'm talking about. If you are connecting the human mind to a grid, a global technological grid, that grid can be centrally controlled. It will take at the centre point very, very few people to run it and even fewer to decide how it's run. It's the stuff of a Hollywood movie, but a group of veterans has filed a lawsuit against the CIA and US Army claiming that the government planted remote controlled devices in their brains. The claims relate to a government program at the US Army's Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland, where scientists tested hundreds of chemical and biological substances on at least 7,800 servicemen. So could this really be happening? Well joining me to help discuss this is Dr. Colin Ross, President of the Colin A. Ross Institute for Psychological Trauma. Dr. Ross, tell me, is this really happening? Did the government really take part in mind control experiments on soldiers? What kind of stories have you heard from the survivors of these experiments? I know you've had access to thousands of documents from the CIA. Well, it's just like you just said, there's two kind of streams of information. There's stories from survivors and then there's the documents. So if I go to the documents first, they're very, very detailed, 15,000 pages plus. And we're starting back in 1950 with projects called Artichoke and Bluebird, which were then rolled over into MKUltra, which in turn was rolled over to MKSearch, and then all the documents stopped in 1973. So in that era of 50 to 73, there's a whole host of different types of mind control experiments, hypnosis, LSD, special interrogation chambers, and brain electrode implants. And so there's projects in the CIA documents and in Army records where electrodes are put into dolphins, and the dolphins are directed by remote transmitter to deliver a bomb to a target. And there's a discussion of similar technology in cats and other animals. There's research funded by the Office of Naval Research published in mainstream journals where electrodes are put in the brains of cats, dogs, and their behaviors controlled, and even human beings at Harvard and Yale. So this is absolutely a documented fact. So tell me how commonplace this was. Is this, are we talking about one program that took place decades ago, or do you think it's happening more often than that? And if so, how could it be so secretive? I mean, most people would think this can't be true. This is stuff out of a movie. Right. It was not just one program back in the 50s, 60s, 70s. It was Harvard, Yale, Tulane, UCLA. So we know there was more than one university involved, more than one branch of the military, more than one program, for a fact. What's going on currently, of course, is all classified. People tell you stories about it, but I can't actually prove that it's happening today. I'm certain that it is, but I can't prove it. Dr. Robert Duncan put together the technology that allows the government to transmit thoughts and voices into the heads of Americans. Dr. Robert Duncan. First question for you. What's negative about what you've done? I've empowered the dark side by some of my work. And what do you mean by that? Technology is neutral. It can be used for good or evil. I've worked on projects for the CIA, Justice Department, Department of Defense. Is this the stuff voices in the head and things like that? Yes. We've run into a few people that claim they got voices in their heads. They sleep inside tinfoil boxes. They do a lot of crazy things, it seems. But when they talk to us, they seem totally normal. They seem totally sane. Are these people crazy or is the government doing this to them? The government's doing this to them. He's not even bothering to hide it. They're called voice of God weapons. So you know for a fact that these weapons that you worked on, they're being used domestically today? Absolutely. There is a very real risk that you are going to become a full blown 24-7 targeted individual. And this technology at that point, when it is nationwide, will be used by automated computer, super computer software programming that will, you know, manipulate the emotions and the behavior and the thoughts of everybody in the United States of America. And it can all be done remotely. It's very much like the microchip kind of tracking the New World Order, this entire, you know, control grid that's supposed to be rolled out against the American people some day. And I'm here to tell you that it's already here. There isn't going to come a day where there's troops in the streets and tanks running around your neighborhood and riot gear and all this stuff. We might have isolated incidents like that. It might get like that every once in a while, but the true control grid is this technology, voice to skull, hive mind, behavior manipulation technology. And it can all be done remotely. It can be done simply by targeting you with the frequency, walking into the resident frequency of your DNA and your mind. And in that manner, you can completely track, trace and control your 24 hours a day. So what we're talking about here is total technological control in a way that I don't think the average person can be completely grasped at level. Your five sense reality can be manipulated just straight up. And so we're going to live in a world we're seeing is not believing. You're going to be trapped in this matrix that they've been building for decades. They've built this whole structure that they've placed over the natural world and they can bypass your senses with it. Literally, that's what it means to say a world where you can't tell the difference anymore between reality and what that is and this matrix. We saw realistic, you will not be able to tell the difference between that game and the reality as we know it. And it's not a coincidence at all that all the movies and TV shows that you're seeing come out right now are just right there to reinforce this idea to you. That reality is not what you think it is. You aren't who you think you are. There's a hidden secret you haven't been told about everything. It's all coming together. There's a reason people refer to this as spiritual warfare. Take all this together out to its logical conclusion. And it's like every episode of the Twilight Zone is now being mixed together in a blender and unleashed onto society. It's beyond the matrix. The research is conducted by the US military's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or DARPA, which we know too well by these robot videos. The new program is called Neural Engineering System Design or NESD, which aims to develop an implantable neural interface connecting humans directly to computers. Philip Alvelda, N-E-S-D manager for DARPA said its goal was to upgrade the tools that we have to really open the channel between the human brain and modern electronics. At the moment, human computer interfaces are able to connect between 100 and 1000 brain neurons to a machine at the time. DARPA aims to refine this technology to connect individual neurons. This would give much finer control, reduce noise and speed up communications between a human and a computer. DARPA's website confirms the news, also citing that among the program's potential applications are devices that could compensate for deficits inside our hearing by feeding digital auditory or visual information into the brain at a resolution and experiential quality far higher than a possible with current technology. Considering the DARPA's research has an end goal of military application, it's not hard to imagine where that could be used. So what exactly would the government do when they would control someone's mind? What could they make someone do when they manipulated their brains? Well, what it describes in the documents and in the published papers is there's actually photographs of a 16-year-old girl, which has got a series of electrodes in her brain, depending on which buttons are being pushed on the transmitter. She's either strumming her guitar, pounding furiously on the wall, or staring off into space. With the animals, they're actually directed to walk or swim to a target, so you can control the actual physical motion and the mental state. How detailed and how fine-tuned that's gotten since 1970, again, I don't know, because it's all classified. And it must have gotten a lot more developed. This technology can also be used to manipulate the emotions of the target. It can induce fear, love, hate. It can cause you to be nervous. It can cause you to be confident. It can cause you to be depressed. It can cause you to be happy. It can cause you to feel any fucking emotion at any time by artificially inducing them. This technology can be used to beam images and even motion pictures into one's brain. Images and motion pictures that are so realistic that you think you're actually watching a movie or seeing something in reality. It's like a virtual reality 3D rendering that takes place within the target's mind. Let's imagine that we could take our brain out of our body and keep it alive in a glass box. Then let's get a computer filled with information related to a particular setting, such as image, sound and smell. We'll connect this computer to the brain with electrodes and send the pre-recorded data to the brain. As our brain receives these signals, it will see and live the setting that the computer is transmitting. We could also send signals to the brain from this computer about our own image. For example, we could send the electrical information, such as the sight, hearing and touch, that we would experience while sitting at a desk. Our brain would perceive that we were a businessman sitting in his office. This imaginary world would continue as long as the information kept coming from the computer. And we would never realize that we were actually a brain sitting in a glass box. Our reality is increasingly being manipulated and mediated by technology to a point that it's merging, it's blending. And I think people are starting to feel it. It's not possible that a simulation is one day going to be inevitable, that we're going to have something that's indistinguishable from regular reality. It seems like people are longing towards some weird log cabin type nostalgic. Yeah, like holding on, like clinging, just dragging the nails through the mud, like, don't take me yet. The World Wide Web only gives us the illusion of being present. But the reality is we're only in our homes connecting to digital space. So that presence is an illusion. And once we get to a point of augmented and virtual reality, well, that just takes the phrase spirit of slumber to a whole new unprecedented level. And so once you've connected the targeted individual with the frequency and they resonate together, then you have a perfect avenue upon which to send and receive information back and forth. And that's exactly how they manipulate someone's thoughts. They send voices into someone's head. They manipulate their emotions. They manipulate their behavior. And then that's also how they receive back from the individual in real time the vital signs, the emotions, the thoughts, what the person's seeing, what the person's hearing. And then all that information, of course, is rendered on a computer elsewhere via software and it can be monitored and tracked in real time. It can literally stop your own thoughts from happening and replace them with other thoughts by sending thoughts to your head. And it's so sophisticated that you cannot tell where these thoughts are coming from. There's no way to discern that they are coming from somewhere other than your own mind. So you can imagine how bad this would be for people that don't even realize this technology exists. And they're having these thoughts which they think are spontaneous because being under the influence of this technology now, kind of having been on both sides of it, I am just amazed at the way it works. And I know that the thoughts that they beam into your head originate from the exact same place in your mind that your own natural thoughts originate from. So if I didn't know I was under the influence of this technology, then I would have no idea that anyone was influencing my thoughts at all. And that's exactly what it can be used for. It can be used to sway people in terms of their opinion, to make them go along with a certain agenda. It can be used to turn groups of people or individuals against each other for whatever purpose. I'm a former naval officer. I graduated in the United States Naval Academy. I have a degree in control systems engineering. I worked as a surface warfare officer in electronics warfare and nuclear engineering jobs. While I was in the service, I found out there's an ongoing non-consensual human experiment and it's testing a human-machine interface weapon. Now did you stumble upon this? Were you privy to it? Yeah, it was an issue where I think it was the next level up in the chain of command. If there's three or four jobs you could take, there was a couple of them where you might be right into this program. So we've got this issue here where we have a non-consensual experiment with a group of American citizens. Some former military, but a lot of just unsuspecting citizens. It's a group of people here in the United States. They're calling themselves targeted individuals. People from all walks of life and a lot of it is people who can't fight back. It seems like predominantly the folks we talk to on the calls are about 70% women, single women who live alone, that may not have a technical background that could even imagine something like this has happened in the past or could happen now. Now I understand how you can do something non-consensually because it's not like you're going to the VA to get a prostate examine and suddenly you're like, wow, something's going on. They're just picking you out using it. You don't know it. Yeah, completely wireless. So you have to infiltrate them with something though, right? Something has to touch there. Not necessarily. A lot of people think that it can be done completely remote, but the only people they're going to know for sure are the ones that work with this technology. This is something where you're going to get, for the scientist portion, you're going to spend about six years developing your skills as a neuroscience, and then as an operator that will work with the finished system, you're going to get at least 18 months to two years of... Which like, nurse weapons are great until they turn it against you. Natural question, how concerned are you going on the air and talking about this and walking across? Why don't you just disappear and chill a coffee? No, no, I would just not. There's no way. These people are... This is like a torture weapon. I couldn't live with myself knowing that it's like not stepping in ahead of the Holocaust or not stepping in. You just made it up to like Capitol Hill? Are there any senators who say... This group has done public outreach for something like 30 years, and then a couple of people came out of the government. One of them came out of the CI that worked with this equipment. He's got multiple degrees out of Harvard and Dartmouth. He's talked on the radio just for quite a long time trying to let people know about this program. And it just doesn't go anywhere with the government, so it really needs to happen kind of grassroots organically that people need to know that this is happening. But wouldn't there be people in the military or government angry about what you're doing, about spreading the word, not wanting people to know that this technology exists? You can't worry about that. You're talking about, you know, they've tortured people to the point where they're going and committing mass shootings. Those are not the people you need to worry about. That's not what the military is about. There's a strong ethical undercurrent there. If they're given an unlawful order, they know not to follow it. And this is clearly a case where, you know, this is a rogue program. So we have this up on our blog, on the Facebook. Where do people go, Dave, to find out if you've intrigued them? Where do they go to get all the information? You can reach me at Facebook, David Voetz, also TI in America Cross Country Walk on both GoFundMe and the Facebook page. You have to remember, this CIA has a long history of experimenting on our citizens, right? LSD. Sure. Okay, we're talking here like going back to MK-Hulter and all that in the 60s and 70s. But we were told all that stopped. Is that untrue? Untrue. These programs continue under new names, new budgets. It's the ultimate weapon. Are there citizens of this country that are being abused with this technology? Worse than abuse. That's a light word. They are being tortured. Now the brain is an amazing organ. When it functions, there are millions and millions of neurons that become active. And what we've done at DARPA is develop the technology in order to sense these signals in real time. Or even write signals into the brain. You can send those signals into a computer. That computer can interpret what all of those signals actually mean when you're thinking about trying to do something. And we can place these sensors anywhere in your brain or even in your peripheral nervous system, right? The nerves that are outside of your brain. So while you may have thought of neuro technology as I've just described you as being something way off in the future, it's actually a technology that exists today and we're actually using it with humans. So we started in animal subjects. We said, okay, let's try these sensors out. Can we read out the signals in real time? And can we do something simple like control a robotic arm? And we showed that we could actually do that, just having the animal think about it. And once we've proved out that technology, we said, okay, we're ready to go to humans. Can we place the same technology in the human brain and restore the ability to move and even sense after you've been injured? And I'm going to show you a couple of examples of this. Yes, we could do that. And we said, okay, again, this is DARPA. We tried to push the limits of what's possible. We said, okay, if we can do that for movement and sensation, can we try to do something even more complex? So we went to memory in the human and said, okay, for humans, we could restore their ability to form and recall memories. Again, direct brain interface. The University of Oxford Functional Neurosurgery Group released a new report claiming that brain implants could be used to steal, spy on, alter or control human memories. A brain-to-machine interface is a system that allows a brain to directly communicate with a robot or computer. A necessary part of a brain-to-machine interface is an external EEG or, for a more advanced connection, a brain implant. The computer or robot controlled by a brain-to-machine interface can be very local, such as a computerized prosthetic arm or extremely distant. Experiments to date have included paralyzed individuals controlling robot arms and typing on computer screens with their thoughts, and even featured rat neurons piloting flight simulators. Communication does not need to be only in the direction of brain-to-machine. Information sent from machine to brain has already been used to create sensations of touch. In theory, brain-to-machine interfaces open up the possibility of avatar technology, not simply controlling an external limb or a computer screen, but controlling an entire artificial you, allowing you to be effectively in two places at the same time. But for long-distance travel, be warned, it might be a bit disorienting as you experience an 8-minute delay between your thoughts on Earth and your avatar's movements on Mars. Would you want to explore Paris with a robotic avatar while your biological body mums on the couch? Or take a nice hike while you mentally controlled your work computer? Watch where you're going, even if you are in two places at once, your attention might not be there. This technology manipulates the electrical signals in the brain, thus controlling thoughts and feelings and emotions and sensations throughout the body. It works by rewiring the brain by creating new neuropathways and destroying existing neuropathways. Thus, this literally changes the way a person thinks and thus behaves. This technology can also be used to control the muscle movement of the target. It can take over one's hands or feet while driving and make you press on the accelerator or press on the brake or turn. This can be used to cause accidents, it can also be used to prevent accidents from happening. This technology can also tap into the optical nerve of the target and the auditory system of the target, so that those monitoring the target can see what the target is seeing and hear what the target is hearing. This information is then downloaded and stored on a computer in a highly secure, classified site on servers that are guarded by some of the tightest security in the world. This results in the individual's entire day, everything they see, everything they hear, everything they experience, and everything they feel being recorded till the end of time. Captain Harwich continues her reporting on a place where all that data is heading. Bluffdale, Utah, 25 miles south of Salt Lake City, the NSA is nearing completion on a gargantuan new project. It's named the Utah Data Center. The NSA will neither confirm nor deny the specifics, but some estimate the center will be capable of storing five zeta bytes of data, or enough to store every email, cell phone call, Google search and surveillance camera video in America for a very long time. All the NSA would tell us is that the Utah Data Center is a facility for the intelligence community that will have a major focus on cyber security. All right, order and take off. We weren't given access last summer, but we could see it from the sky. I want you to look real close because right now we're 500 feet over the Utah Data Center and this is the closest you're going to get without a security clearance. You can actually see the cranes right now after 12 o'clock. Wow! From the sky? It's huge. It's really a turnkey situation where it can be turned quickly and become a totalitarian state pretty quickly. The capacity to do that is being set up. That's a chilling assessment from Bill Binney who worked at the NSA for nearly four decades, starting as a data analyst in the days before desktop computers. After 9-11, the NSA began a warrantless surveillance program approved by President Bush. My estimate was that they were collecting on the order of three billion a day. That's just internal to this country. In simple terms, NSA was spying on Americans inside this country. That's correct. Technology can also tap into the optical nerve of the target and the auditory system of the target so that those monitoring the target can see what the target is seeing and hear what the target is hearing. This information is then downloaded and stored on a computer in a highly secure, classified site. Breaking news this evening is the identity of the man who sent the Obama administration into defend and explain mode this week. His name is Edward Snowden. He's an American former CIA employee in computer technician. Today he came out as the leaker of classified NSA documents that spell out a secret surveillance program. A student gave an on camera interview to the Guardian newspaper and we're playing it for you in its entirety. Here's some more of it. Listen. When I think about an instance that really just struck me as, oh my God, we can do this. And that we can do it to anyone. And that we can do it to anyone was that people in NSA analysts can actually watch people's internet communications, watch them draft correspondence, and actually watch their thoughts form as they type. Watch their thoughts form as they type. You write a message, you know, an analyst at NSA or any other service out there that's using this kind of attack against people. Any other service out there that's using this kind of attack against people can actually see you write sentences in the backspace over your mistakes and then change the words and kind of pause and think about what you wanted to say, pause and think about what you wanted to say, and then change it and then change it, change it. And it's this extraordinary intrusion, not just into your communications, your finished messages, but your actual drafting process into the way you think, into the way you think, into the way you think. One thing you have to understand is that within the security business, most of the people working there are ex-military and ex-intelligence operatives, and many of them in fact are still active intelligence operatives, and have simply been reassigned to domestic duty to work with a private security company, specifically for the purposes of carrying out this highly illegal program that's being run against TIs all over America. So, full-blown TIs, what I would call people that are getting the voice to skull, the frequency and the organized stalking, I've heard is between 1 and 2 million, and that could be completely off. But one of the things I'm concerned about is the technology is being researched and developed in Seattle, and it realizes emotion manipulation and behavior manipulation without the game stalking and without the voice to skull aspects. And so this use of the technology can be done very covertly to the point where the person it's being used against will not know that this technology is being used against them. And that is one of my main concerns and one of the reasons why I want to bring more light to this technology and to this issue, because this technology could potentially be being used against tens to hundreds of millions of Americans every day. I mentioned in some of my podcasts how there are field effects where they will not direct this technology at an individual, but create a general field of frequency in a geographical area so that everybody within that geographical area is feeling the effects of the technology. It's more of a general application of the technology instead of an individual specific application of the technology. But when you consider that use of it and the fact that it is used for emotion and thought and behavior modification, then we could potentially be looking at many, many millions of people across the country that are under the influence of the technology today right now. Hundreds of people in the Valley say they are hearing voices in their heads. Those voices are being transmitted by microwave or other methods. Well, several viewers asked us to investigate what they call electronic harassment. KMIR 6's Angela Monroe joins us now with what she's discovered, Angela. Electronic harassment, synthetic telepathy, voice to school technology. Chances are you haven't heard of these terms, but after searching the Internet, I found dozens of websites dedicated to the phenomenon and several Valley residents who say they're victims. How much more can you invade me than to go into my brain? It sounds like somebody else is reading the book only its thoughts. We're not having a group hallucination. This is actually something that's happening. These men all live in the area, didn't know each other before the voices started, and say someone is playing mind games with them. Mostly it's a lot of derogatory comments about whatever you're thinking about. Kevin Bond says he used to have a normal life. When I was living in the San Diego area, I was looking for a federal judge, and I noticed that I was being followed by a whole bunch of people. According to the websites, what Bond is describing is called gang stalking. He moved to Palm Springs to escape. I started hearing, as you'll hear, hearing voices and what they'll call voice to skull or microwave hearing. Bob Stansfield says his experience was similar and started a decade ago. I think we're active in following me around here, and I started hearing the voices a little bit after the vehicular stalking. Randall Ringer says the voices started when he was undergoing chemotherapy. The first thing that was said was Randall Ringer, and I sat up straight and I went into the bathroom and I looked in the mirror. I looked myself in the eyes and I said, did that really happen? Bond says he's found more than 300 victims locally and is tracking others across the state through billboards. Bond says neurotransmitter chips that run off body electricity have been inserted into some people. And they assign cell phone numbers to them. The cell phone numbers are then run through a computer and a computer translates your thoughts. This crime has been available to the military for 60 years. As many of the test subjects so-called, the people are being experimented on, or as within the program as they're called a target. As many of them have already learned, one of the key means of covering up this program is to use the psychological profession to do so. Those who speak out about this issue are funneled to psychiatrists for evaluation. The psychiatrists are working with those who are running this program. In many cases they are directly paid by them to render a diagnosis of schizophrenic multiple personality disorder, delusional paranoid, depressed. Upon the test subjects, the targets, so that they will be discredited, so that if they talk out any further, or they ever start making any progress against this program, they are inherently discredited because those who run this program will simply release the psychological files and claim that the person is mentally ill. This is a perfect way to cover up such a technology whose main feature, and most popular feature, most well-known feature, is voice to skull, which induces sound within the cranial cavity of the test subject, of the target themselves, so that when that person goes to speak out about it, when they go to seek help from their fellow human beings, and their fellow human beings say, what is it that's happening to you? The target will then say, I'm hearing voices inside my head. It's the result of voices to skull technology, it's a sophisticated microwave auditory effect. It's radio frequency signals that are being beamed at my fucking head, that are causing me to hear sounds and voices inside my head. Obviously, if members of the general public are not aware of the existence of this technology, which many of them are not, most of them are not, then they will interpret that as concerning. They will feel concern for the target, and they will conclude that this person must be crazy, and as a result, they will recommend psychological evaluation for that person. You can see the way this is going to go, and the way it is going right now, as good people, helpless people that are being abused and tortured and enslaved and experimented upon in America today, American citizens cry out for help from their fellow Americans, and their fellow Americans say, why don't you take some Prozac, because we think you're schizophrenic. When this is a highly technical program, all of the symptoms are induced by a technology that is so fucking sophisticated, it is horrifying beyond description. And you mentioned that you are convinced that this could still be going on today. What other kind of experiments do you think the CIA could be doing today? Well, I would say intelligence agencies around the world probably have Manchurian candidate sleepers operative today, and they're using a whole range of techniques to control and create them, which is in terrorist organizations, there's going to be the religious doctrine part of it, but it's the basic mind control programming technology that we've known about for decades. You control a person's life space, control the information flow, talk to them, talk to them, talk to them, convince them, convince them, convince them, frighten them, terrorize them, soften them up with hypnosis, drugs, which can be IV drugs or drugs by mouth. So it's a whole range of different techniques, it's not just one thing. It was here not so long ago on a tragic night that has many wondering what can make a man snap and lose control. I'm going to say my last words. It's really unfortunate that I have to make this video. You see, I am a victim of covert harassment and electronic harassment and gang stalking. I'm what's called a targeted individual. On November 20, 2014, 31-year-old Byron May walks into Strozer Library on the campus of Florida State University and opens fire. Three people are injured. May tries to leave campus, and a shootout with police in front of the library ends violently. The medical examiner confirming May was shot 24 times by police. 6-0-3. We continue with the deadly school shooting and we're learning more about what confessed gunman Nicholas Cruz told investigators during an 11-hour interrogation. The transcript is more than 200 pages long. And while it was heavily redacted, we've learned that Cruz told the BSO detective that he heard a demon in his head. That police shooting down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, as we said, three police officers were killed. Three others were wounded when they were ambushed by a gunman who was dressed in all black. That suspect who was killed by other officers at the scene has now been identified as Gavin Long. He's a former Marine whose 29th birthday was Sunday, the day of this attack. And a lot of TIs, y'all don't even know that harassment is a felony. Stalking with harassment is a damn felony. That's a felony charge. You definitely have the right to defend yourself. And if someone is, and you know gang stalking is, they're trying to tempt you, they're trying to make you attempt suicide. That's attempted murder. If someone is trying to tempt you to force you into suicide, isn't that attempted murder? Come on now. Let's open our eyes, get it together. Hey, defend yourself at all costs. Stand in your righteousness. Die in your righteousness. Period. A shooting at the oldest Navy facility in the country, home to 15,000 including the Navy's top officer, and only a few miles from the White House and Capitol building. Panic ensued in Washington, D.C. today as the death toll mounted. We got a report on the 4-4 of a male with a shotgun, multiple shots fired, multiple people down. We're still waiting for the OK to be seen as being secured. The FBI released images of the weapon, a Remington 870 shotgun, which had messages etched on the side. Better off this way. And my ELF weapon. An apparent reference to extremely low frequency waves. Officials reckon he believed he was being controlled by them in the months before he killed 12 people. At this point, I can confirm that there are multiple indicators that Alexis held a delusional belief that he was being controlled or influenced by extremely low frequency or ELF electromagnetic waves. U.S. and Cuban officials say they're investigating allegations of a possible acoustic attack on U.S. Embassy staff in Havana last year. Just to add to the confusion, there is speculation coming out of Washington that it may actually have been a third country that was involved in this. Now Russia is the leading suspect. NBC News has learned according to three U.S. officials and two others briefed on the investigation. Evidence they say backed up by highly secret communications intercepts, collected during a lengthy and ongoing investigation, involving the FBI, CIA and other agencies. U.S. officials also tell NBC News investigators now believe the Americans were deliberately targeted. Can I ask you a question about some of the technology that you're developing to fight the war on terror, specifically directed energy and high-power microwave technology. When do you envision that you can weaponize that type of technology? It is in, for the most part, the kinds of things you're talking about are in varying early stages. Do you want to give anything you can add? I don't think I would add much. I think they are in early stages and probably not ready for employment at this point. In the normal order of things, when you invest in research and development and begin a developmental project, you don't have any intention or expectations that one would use it. On the other hand, the real world intervenes from time to time and you reach in there and take something out that is still in a developmental stage and you might use it. So your question is not answerable. It depends on what happens in the future and how well things move along the track and whether or not someone feels it's appropriate to reach into a development stage and see if something might be useful. As was the case with the unmanned aerial vehicles. What do you think you're going to experiment with? I think that's the point. We have, I think, from the beginning of this conflict, I think General Frank has been very open to looking at new things if there are new things available and has been willing to put them into the fight even before they've been fully wrung out. I think that's not referring to these particular cases of directed energy or high-powered microwave. Who are the controllers? I mean, is that our president? The Federal Reserve? No. So these are people within our government at a certain level making these decisions and they're not necessarily our president or our elected officials. That's exactly right. Wow. That makes it even more difficult because they can't be removed. They can't be removed and they're difficult to find. They hide in the dark crevices of our government. You worked for these people. You worked on this. You helped to develop it. I was naive. I did not know how the technologies were going to be put together and the ultimate weapon created. You're not still working for it. No. You're unequivocally looking me right in the eye right now and you're telling me you have no more to do with this and that you're out to expose it. That's correct, sir. With your background and what you know, can you give us a hint on what we ought to do? No. No. Is it too late? I actually believe it's too late. So what you're telling me, every one of us should be in fear of this because every one of us at some point will be targeted. The technologies advance that far. Every single man, woman and child in the United States of America will be under the influence of this technology and as you can see going forward, what's going to happen is a dividing line is going to be drawn in America and it's not going to be Democrat or Republican or Black and white, rich, poor, you know, Jew, Gentile, religious differences, whatever it is, it's going to be based on who is on the right and the wrong side of this technology, who is on the right and the wrong side of this program. And so if you are not a part of this program, then there is a very real risk that you are going to become a full-blown, 24-7 targeted individual. And this technology at that point when it is nationwide will be used by automated computer, super computer software programming that will manipulate the emotions and the behavior and the thoughts of everybody in the United States of America. And it can all be done remotely. It's very much like the microchip kind of tracking the New World Order, this entire, you know, control grid that's supposed to be rolled out against the American people someday. And I'm here to tell you that it's already here. There isn't going to come a day where there's troops in the streets and tanks rolling down your neighborhood and riot gear and all this stuff. We might have isolated incidents like that. It might get like that every once in a while, but the true control grid is this technology, voice to skull, hive mind, behavior manipulation technology. And it can all be done remotely. It can be done simply by targeting you with the frequency, walking into the resonant frequency of your DNA and your mind, and in that manner completely track and trace and control you 24 hours a day. Doctor, to deliver this, how do they get into your head? I've heard of these Gwen towers. They allegedly were used before and now they claim that they're not used for anything. They do match up with the properties and necessary capabilities. They easily could be broadcasting across the country, messages to people and causing them extreme pain. That's part of the whole world domination strategy. Control the population from subconsciously to consciously. And now we've got a motive. Controlling dissenters, controlling the world, controlling you and me. The Internet of Things and the Foggy Grid is the end game of the New World Order and it is the New World Order itself. The New World Order being the New World where everything is orderly. Everything is tracked. Everything is accounted for. Every move, every action, every conversation, every thought, everything people do is tracked. When you're looking at the Internet of Things and this 5G surveillance grid and what is really coming online, this technocracy that is coming online, everything else kind of pales into insignificance because in this AI grid that is coming online to control us and it will be an AI grid. It will be controlled by AI. This is in their own plans. In this grid, there is no one you can really point the finger at. There's no government you can bring down. There's no one you can really say is the controlling hand at that point. All control leaves the hands of the people and control gets handed over to the Internet itself. And that's what they're working towards and it's in all their own documents. We're now at a stage where we're putting in what's called 5G, which is a special type of broadcast for high density information transfers. And it turns out that this is the same frequency bands that are used in the crowd dispersal weaponry. 5G first and foremost is densification. So it's significantly more transmitters close proximity to a human. And it is also a sophisticated illegal unlawful transmitter. What I mean by that is it is a high-gib, dielectric lens antenna. And what that allows 5G transmitters to do is to 3D map its environment in your home. The 868 MHz frequency is specific for battlefield interrogation systems. So some gigahertz, it allows the signal to travel through concrete brickwork with ease and it can actually data gulla. It is a target acquiring system. The frequency that's being emitted by the device will have an effect on a geographical location, let's say downtown Seattle. And so what they can do is within this general field, they can broadcast a frequency that affects human beings within that frequency field and can induce a general mood of let's say happiness or sadness, anger, agitation, peacefulness. And in this way they can have an overall effect in the city. And I have seen this done and it is remarkable how effective it is because you will walk down the street of Seattle and literally see people all in a bad mood, all at the same time. And they do not know each other. And then you go over a block or two to a different office building and you walk in and the exact same things going on there. It is very, very concerning. So within that then, that overall bubble or area of frequency where everybody, let's say, is in a bad mood, they can still inject what would be an individual specific frequency to the targeted individual themselves, let's say the homeless person in Seattle that's being experimented on 24 hours a day. So they will be under the influence of the general agitated mood or bad mood that everybody else is in and then they can more privilege be manipulated by the frequency that's being directed solely at them. Phase 2 Rear is basically radar off the battlefield. It is extremely good at identifying targets and being able to lock on the targets. And not only that, it can specifically target you as an individual. So any judge sitting on an interesting case, let's say, any lawyer, any barrister, anybody doing any work that is potentially controversial, your life could be a threat. So the antenna design that you currently have non-stop of these LED streetlights, masquerade as a control management system, it basically battlefield interrogation equipment. The first phase of Rear unit was actually called Mammet, used by the Germans during the Second World War to identify Allied aircraft. Obviously things have moved on significantly since then. The radio frequencies, the microwave signals, the entire spectrum of radio frequencies can be used within a certain range to produce all sorts of different effects. So the way it works is a device broadcasts a radio frequency, let's say, at an individual. And that radio frequency will hook up with the resonant frequency of the individual's mind or body, or in this case, DNA. And what happens is once the resonant frequency is found in the targeted individual and the broadcast frequency matches up with that resonant frequency, those two frequencies interlock and they can be thought of as one frequency or one energy. And what happens is between the broadcast frequency and the individual that's receiving the broadcast frequency, once they are resonating together, a superhighway of frequency along which information can be sent is created. And so you can think of it just like fiber optic signals that you use to send signals over the Internet that connect people to the Internet. It's the exact same thing, only a wireless application of that. Rossaday was working with the CIA and exchanging technology and study data with Russians back in the 60s and 70s and even further back. And he figured out scientifically, demonstratably, how non-ionizing radiation and various specific frequencies from microwaves or from other signals, how they could alter human and animal behavior. For instance, a simple 10 hertz wave could put someone into a stupor within a couple of minutes using neuroelectric devices that they developed by the 70s. They could put individuals or entire towns to sleep on command. They can aggravate people. They can alter their sexual preferences. They can delete their memories. They can turn on desire. They can turn on repulsion. And they can otherwise hijack someone's spontaneous and natural behavior. They can literally hijack your nervous system and your brain. And that was 30 or 40 years ago. Now things are very advanced. They're very precise and they're very far along. There's discussions now at the Davos World Economic Forum that approach the topic of mind reading and literal mind control. And these devices, the capability to do it is built into everything, every handheld unit, every laptop, mobile device that everyone's carrying around. And once things are fast enough with 5G, all bets are off. The constant ubiquitous connection with these next generation 5G towers. But what else can you say? I don't want to add paranoia. I don't want to make people fearful. But basically, where can you run from this? Once the system is fully launched and up, it's going to be just like the Terminator Genesis system. It's going to be the rise of AI and it's going to be like there's no looking back. We must reject the notion that the 5G future will be the sole province of urban areas. The 5G revolution will touch all corners of our country. We are the pioneers of a new spectrum frontier. No one gave permission for this because most people don't fully understand what's happening or why it matters. They're going to click on little agreements on their cell phone for the different sites they visit and they're going to have no idea how much is going to be taken from that. But it's clear that this is not a good bargain and people need to be warned. They should try to oppose this in their local cities and where they can and try to challenge these companies because they don't want to face resistance and they don't want a population that knows about the dangers and the risks of this technology. In 1953, the Russians began to bombard the U.S. Embassy in Moscow with electromagnetic radiation in the microwave spectrum. But the fact was kept secret from the embassy employees. Dr. Henry Kissinger sent a secret memo giving hazard pay to embassy personnel in the 1970s. Before the attacks, the USSR had met with the U.S. to try to head off an arms race in electromagnetic weapons but were refused. In retaliation, they began microwaving the U.S. Embassy. It is possible that the U.S. government took advantage of the situation and used the embassy staff as microwave guinea pigs. The Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency, ARPA, set up a lab at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and participated in Project Pandora. Scientists began zapping monkeys to study the biological effects of highly concentrated microwave frequencies. Similar studies were conducted at the VA Hospital in Kansas City, University of Rochester, Brooks Air Force Base, Johns Hopkins, MIT, the MITRE Corporation, University of Pennsylvania, and other domestic and foreign labs. Something else the 5G grid can do is it can see through walls, houses, what you're carrying along the street, money, and if you're carrying a weapon. If you are carrying a weapon, it can disable you with a millimetre wave or send a signal to a drone and have you target it from the air. All of this is capable through the 5G system. It's also possible to take control of vehicles with computers in them. It's an all-encompassing system. And this is not just being used for communication. This is being used for surveillance and control. The street lights will be connected to form an IoT network. The street lights can measure air quality, locate vacant parking spaces, monitor traffic flow of vehicles and pedestrians, and monitor the traffic flow of vehicles and pedestrians. The city will also replace 14,000 street lights with technology that allows them to dim or brighten manually or automatically. The city will also replace 14,000 street lights with technology that allows them to dim or brighten manually or automatically. According to natural light conditions. The installation will begin this summer with the potential for 3,000 more sensors to be added in the future. This is not just an incremental change. This is a big step up. It's a sea change. And on-slot is not an improper word. It's a bombardment. So instead of a cell tower, one mile or two miles from you, and you still have cell phone service, we're going to have antennas every block. And some porcelains are going to have one mount to two utility pole, maybe less than 20 meters from their home. So this kind of invasive bombardment with this many antennas, I mean, just in one square mile, if you do the math one per block and 16 blocks per mile, that's about 250 antennas per square mile. The millimeter wave is untested. Former FCC chairman Tom Wheeler openly said that they don't plan to test. We won't wait for the standards. And then our appeal also addresses the fact that there's a plan to roll out 5G through satellites in low-worth orbit. So 20,000 satellites, which will cover every square foot of the planet with a 5G signal. So this amazing set of missions aims to create a super low-latency telecommunications network. And how are they going to do this? Not by launching just these 60 satellites, which let's face it is a damn amazing mission by itself, but by launching around 12,000 satellites in three sophisticated orbital shells around the world. No big deal, right? The better question might be why are SpaceX attempting to create this network? What this whole system is leading towards, folks, is complete digital control of everybody and emerging of human beings with AI. And when you look at Elon Musk and some of the stuff he's been putting out, he's saying that it is necessary for us to merge with AI. It's going to be the only way to save us against AI completely taking over. And he's saying this needs to be done through a neural net. And it was into this. If you assume any rate of advancement in AI, we will be left behind by a lot. That is Elon Musk, the inventor and entrepreneur behind such futuristic endeavors as Tesla, SpaceX and Hyperloop. And as you heard, Elon Musk has AI, artificial intelligence, on his mind these days. He says AI machines could soon outsmart us all. And his philosophy is if we can't beat him, we should join him by implanting AI computers directly into our brains. So from a long-term existential standpoint, that's like the purpose of Neuralink is to create a high bandwidth interface to the brain such that we can be symbolic with AI. Because we have a bandwidth problem. You just can't communicate through your fingers. It's too slow. So I think if we can effectively merge with AI by improving the neural link between your cortex and your digital extension yourself, which already, like I said, already exists, just has a bandwidth issue. Pay close attention to what he said there. What he said was that this interface already exists. It's just that they have to improve the bandwidth. They have bandwidth problems. So how might these bandwidth problems be improved? It's not just that 5G is faster than 4G and that's it. It has other features such as much lower latency. It also has higher capacity for bandwidth and higher capacity for number of devices. SpaceX took the first step towards its orbiting internet system late Thursday. A Falcon 9 rocket launched from Florida's Cape Canaveral with a payload of 60 small satellites. Eventually CEO Elon Musk wants to put 12,000 up there. As these smart technologies begin to invade our homes, we are becoming near nodes in a giant network that we yet but dimly comprehend. Called the Internet of Things, the plan is to create a network that will eventually include every single object on the planet. And as the public is finally becoming aware, such networks provide golden opportunities for corporations and governments alike to collect data and spy on the population. This is not mere conjecture. Before becoming enmeshed in an affair that ultimately derailed his career, former CIA director David Petraeus bragged openly about how these smart technologies would allow intelligence agencies to spy on everyone in their own homes using their own appliances. Speaking at a summit for Incutel, the CIA's venture capital firm, Petraeus noted, items of interest will be located, identified, monitored, and remotely controlled through technologies such as radio frequency identification, sensor networks, tiny embedded servers, and energy harvesters. In practice, these technologies could lead to rapid integration of data from closed societies and provide near-continuous, persistent monitoring of virtually anywhere we choose. Whether Petraeus' own downfall is a result of FBI eavesdropping on private emails as part of a plan to warn future would-be whistleblowers, poetic justice, or mere irony, it is nonetheless instructive. When everything that anyone does is tracked, traced, and databaseed at all times, from our dishwasher usage to our television viewing to our toilet flushes, no one will be able to avoid the gaze of the state, regardless of whether or not they have something to hide. As IT worlds Kevin Fogarty observed, if J. Edgar Hoover were alive, he would die of jealousy at the technologies available to the would-be big brothers of today. For the unimaginative out there, Hollywood yarns like enemy of the state have provided fictional examples of what can go wrong if someone, somewhere, abuses the power of information and surveillance to target an innocent person in the wrong place at the wrong time. To be sure, the power that these technologies give for agencies or corrupt groups within those agencies to destroy the lives of targeted individuals is itself a fitting answer to the question of why government surveillance should be troubling to us. But beyond what can happen to specific targeted individuals in such a scenario is a much larger question. What if this data were being fed into a database so gargantuan it contains a digital version of every single person on the planet? And what if that database were being used by the Department of Defense to war game various scenarios, from public reactions to natural disasters to the likelihood of civil unrest in the wake of a declaration of martial law? Remarkably, this is precisely what is happening. It is called the sentient world simulation. The program's aim, according to its creator, is to be a continuously running, continually updated mirror model of the real world that can be used to predict and evaluate future events and courses of action. In practical terms, that equates to a computer simulation of the entire planet, complete with billions of nodes representing every person on the earth. At the time of initial reports on the program five years ago, there were only 62 country-level simulations being run by the US Department of Defense. These simulations grouped humans into composites, with 100 individuals acting as a single node. But already at that time, the US Army had used the systems to create a one-to-one level simulation of potential army recruits. The ultimate aim would be to archive enough data on each individual to be able to make a computer model of everyone on the planet, one that could be used to predict the behaviors and reactions of every single person in the event of various scenarios. The original concept paper for the project was published in 2006, and in 2007 it was reported that both Homeland Security and the Defense Department were already using the system to simulate the American public's reaction to various crises. In the intervening five years, however, there has been almost no coverage at all of the Synthiant World Simulation, or its progress in achieving a model of the earth. Now creating a world simulation is not a new concept, even a Synthiant one has been attempted over and over. For the public, these often came in the form of video games. The problem with these models is that they have to be constantly changed and upgraded. Every time there is a major event, nutrient, or change in the real world. The Synthiant World Simulation does this automatically. So what this is is a synthetic mirror of the world we live in, not a piece of it, but the entire world. And this program constantly recalibrates the simulation based on real-time world events, trends, theories, economics, industry, almost everything you can think of that would contribute to an accurate model. Not to mention the individual pieces of data on every single person represented in the simulation. So to put this in perspective, what this is is a digital clone of our world and everyone in it. A full-blown 24-7 targeted individual. And this technology at that point, when it is nationwide, will be used by automated, computer, supercomputer software program that will manipulate the emotions and behavior of the thoughts of everybody in the United States of America. A former NSA official claims that the United States is now a hair's breadth from becoming a turnkey totalitarian state. Intelligence communities or agencies of the world are gaining too much influence over how governments operate. And this is moving really to a stasi state, basically. And it's not just the United States, it's countries all around the world. You have to be aware that these agencies are threatening what is fundamental to human rights everywhere. And you've got to ensure that you have some way of verifying and keeping these agencies in line. Though the official mandate of the NSA is to eavesdrop on foreign communications, we now know that it has long been pointing its instruments inward. In the Philippines, circa 1950, CIA Cy were operative at Lansdale, employed a technique known as the Eye of God. At night, operatives would paint an eye on the wall of a house facing a suspected communist or communist sympathizer. The message we are watching you. In some respects, the NSA's well-publicized spying on American citizens has the same effect. The very fact that they have claimed the right to spy on American citizens is a gross violation of their mandate. Similarly, the CIA, which is prohibited from conducting internal security functions within the United States, has repeatedly broken its own rules. Under Operation Chaos, the agency spied on leftists during the Civil Rights Era. Under MKUltra, they used thousands of American citizens as human guinea pigs. During Operation Mockingbird, they illegally propagandized the American public. According to CIA documents, for 25 years, more than 400 American journalists secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency. Some people did this in exchange for money, while others did this voluntarily. Among the participants were Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists and even famous correspondents. Assignments included intelligence gathering, publishing agency press releases as stories, shaping other stories, and even planting false information with... Do you have any people being paid by the CIA who are contributing to a major circulation in American journalism? We do have people who submit pieces to other two American journals. Do you have any people paid by the CIA who are working for television networks? This, I think, gets into the kind of getting into the details, Mr. Chairman, that I'd like to get into in an executive session. I think I'll get into that. Just as Eisenhower would later warn of a military industrial complex that he himself had helped to create, Truman would voice alarm over the evolution of the Central Intelligence Agency. He came to not only regret it, but to speak out about it. In 1963, 30 days to the day after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Truman actually wrote an op-ed that was published in The Washington Post in which he revealed this, and he said, I never intended it for it to become what it has become. And this is very interesting because that op-ed appeared in the early edition of The Washington Post, and then it was excised from all the later editions that day. Alan Dulles, perhaps the most important of the CIA directors, flew out to Independence, Missouri, to try to get Truman to retract what he had written, and he refused. November 22, 1963, not only did John Kennedy die, is also the day America's free press died. They became Truman aiders, abetters, and protectors of the known murderers of President John F. Kennedy. At the same time the OPC became operational, the National Security Council approved a radical new policy. It secretly authorized the CIA to conduct programs which were officially non-existent, thereby bypassing the U.S. Congress. The NSC ordered that the new operations be deniable, meaning planned and executed, so that any U.S. government responsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons, and that for those uncovered, the U.S. government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility. And that is really the genesis of unacknowledged special access projects. Now a special access project just means you have to have the clearance to get to it, and be read into it, as they say in military speak. But an unacknowledged project, I just want to go through a minute how that works. Let's say that this gentleman is a four-star general, and I'm a colonel. I made a Joe four-star general. But I'm in an unacknowledged special access project dealing with this or some other subject. It can be other things as well. If I am in an unacknowledged project, I am told, and I have one of my most senior military advisors has been in multiple of these. He was in one project that was $2-3 billion. He knew it was more than two, and almost $3 billion, in a project that was off the books. No accounting. President didn't know. Congress didn't know. Tightly held. Military guy working with some corporate folks. And he told me, he says, here's how it works. He says, they take you to a skiff, a secure communication intelligence facility, SCIF. Take all the equipment off of you. Any guns off, cell phones, watches, nothing. Anything metallic. You go into this underground facility, and there's a meeting. And he said, you have a come into Jesus talk. And what happens is that you are told that only the people in that room are read into it. Are read into and cleared to this unacknowledged special access project. And if you speak of it outside of that circle of people, there's one person there with a gun and a bullet. And he takes the bullet out, and he says, it has your name on it. If you speak to anyone, and I mean anyone, your wife, the president, your commander, about what we're doing. And that is how it works. This is not a conspiracy theory. I've been in these skiffs. I've been in a couple places. And I can tell you that is exactly how it operates. The real tragedy of it, though, is that if you have a breakdown in government this severe, those of you who are students of governance, where you can have a CIA director or senior members of the military who are being left out of something very important and which hundreds of billions of dollars per year are going into, then you have no government. So the deep national security state from 1950s until today has devolved into this sub-rosa, unacknowledged, not international, transnational entity with representation in the UK, Canada, Australia, Brazil, China, Russia, former Soviet Union, which on this issue work together like this. It is not responsive to the body politic. It is not responsive to the heads of government or even the heads of committees and cabinet-level people. There are some cabinet-level people, however, who have known. I mentioned a few. There was a CIA director known as George H.W. Bush. But then there are others like Woolsey who wouldn't be told anything. Some presidents have been given a little information and some have been told nothing. The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society. And we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweigh the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. And no official of my administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes, or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know. But we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covet means for expanding its sphere of influence on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissent is assailants, not praised. Its dissent is assailants, not praised. Its dissent is assailants, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. What you know as Stellar Wind has grown. SSO, the expanded special source operations that took over Stellar Wind's share of the pie, has spread all over the world to practically include comprehensive coverage of the United States. Disturbingly, the amount of U.S. communication ingested by NSA is still increasing. Publicly, we complain that things are going dark, but in fact, our accesses are improving. The truth is that the NSA has never in its history collected more than it does now. I know the location of most domestic interception points and that the largest telecommunication companies in the U.S. are between the trust of their customers, which I can prove. We are building the greatest weapon for oppression in the history of man. I am asking your help on a tremendous task of informing and alerting the American people. For I have complete confidence in the response and dedication of our citizens whenever they are fully informed. I not only could not stifle controversy among your readers, I welcome it. This administration intends to be candid about its errors, for as a wise man once said, an error doesn't become a mistake until you refuse to correct it. We intend to accept full responsibility for our errors, and we expect you to point them out when we miss them. Without debate, without criticism, no administration and no country can succeed, and no republic can survive. That is why the Athenian lawmaker, Solar, decreed it a crime for any citizen to shrink from controversy. And that is why our press was protected by the First Amendment, the only business in America specifically protected by the Constitution, not primarily to amuse and entertain, not to emphasize the trivial and the sentimental, not to simply give the public what it wants, but to inform, to arouse, to reflect, to state our dangers and our opportunities, to indicate our crises and our choices, to lead, mold, educate, and sometimes even anger, public opinion. This means greater coverage and analysis of international news, for it is no longer far away and far and close at hand and local. It means greater attention to improved understanding of the news, as well as improved transmission. And it means finally that government at all levels must meet its obligation to provide you with the fullest possible information outside the narrowest limits of national security. And so it is to the printing press, to the recorder of man's deeds, the keeper of his conscience, the courier of his news, that we look for strength and assistance, confident that with your help man will be what he was born to be, free and independent."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_536", "transcript": "Carl, good morning to you. This is really an end of an era because Sheldon Adelson was the last of the casino moguls on the Las Vegas strip, the last founder of a mega brand. At 87, he was still the decision maker for this company. He died last night of non-Hochkins lymphoma, which he battled for some time. It had taken him off multiple earnings calls, though not out of the office throughout the last couple years. His legacy profound. Every market he touched, he changed. Adelson's impact on Macau, his vision for Singapore, his dreams for Las Vegas, he leaves his mark on every integrated resort in every destination. He had a deep abiding love for Israel. He donated generously to conservative politics there and smashed records for political donations in U.S. politics. In fact, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, Sheldon Adelson and his wife were the single largest political donors of the 2020 election cycle, giving $218 million to Republican or conservative groups. They had donated more than $100 million in the 2018 midterms, and in the 2016 presidential election they were Trump's biggest donors. Sheldon Adelson had a massive impact on U.S. politics. All of that, of course, was extraneous to the people who worked for him. Many of his executive team had been with him for decades. Head of communications, Ron Reese told me, today's a day when the housekeepers are crying over the death of Mr. Adelson. He was perceived as anti-union, but executives point out what he paid and he offered for benefits exceeded what unions secured for those workers. And throughout the pandemic, Las Vegas Sands has not laid off any of its 50,000 employees globally, which really, I think, stands out not just in the casino industry, but in business in general. Last Wednesday, the company announced Adelson would take medical leave. It was an indication of how seriously his health was declining. The board named Rob Goldstein, interim chairman and CEO, signaling its thoughts about the potential future leadership here. I also want to mention that the CFO, Patrick Dumont, is Sheldon's son-in-law, and the family retains majority share. Then Adelson's funeral will be held, I'm told, almost immediately in Israel with a memorial plan for a later date in Las Vegas. Carl. Contessa, any clues as to whether or not or how the company's direction or focus might change? After he announced medical leave last week, we already saw analysts speculating about whether Rob Goldstein would entertain the idea of Las Vegas Sands breaking into sports gambling. Sheldon Adelson was a very staunch opponent of internet gambling, spent a lot of money trying to fight it. And we may see some departure on that, because right now, all the businesses that Las Vegas Sands engages in, these integrated resorts, those have all been shut down in the pandemic, where with internet gambling, of course, that can stay up and running even if their physical casinos are locked down. We'll have to wait and see if that comes through to fruition. Shepard Smith here. Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."}

In the ceiling you know, sometimes it was water coming through, sometimes it was gas. So now we will enter in this knowing because sometimes we will die, sometimes we can come back alive. Before entering no towels or anything they will give you a bar of soap. In this bar of soap there were three initials in German. That I forgot how to pronounce in German but it means pure Jewish faith into the soap. It was meant that they were making the soap out of the corpse of the living, the mecto-soaps. They were making out of the corpse of the living many things. They will make that parchment to make that to the lampshades. They will make purses for them, for the skin of the dead people. They will make beautiful skins like purses for the Germans. They will make anything and then the flesh, sometimes when they burn, if they were not burned they will use it to make sausages and to make poloni that they were giving us at night to eat. It was like you say, at the beginning we were very kosher, as you say in Rhode Island, we didn't want to touch poloni, not even knowing that it was human. We thought it was from the cow. But then my father, at the beginning 40 days we will see the men from the other side of the fence. They were electric barbed wires. And then my father, he knew very well the Hebrew and all these laws and all these. He told us in Hebrew, dina malchota dina, which means the law of the government is a law. So if you don't eat, you'll starve and you'll die. So God knows that. So don't forget about kashrut and everything, eat whatever they give you. So at the beginning we didn't want to, even that we knew that, we didn't want to touch that poloni. But after that, never mind, we ate anything that will give us."}

The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation revealed in a statement that Phil, who had been an inmate at the California health care facility in Stockton, California since 2013, had passed away from natural causes. While it is currently unknown what caused Phil's death, the CDCR noted that his official cause of death will be determined by the medical examiner in the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office. In the same statement, the CDCR also included an updated mugshot of Phil that was taken last November. Phil, who often wore wigs before his conviction, is seen bald and smiling in the recent mugshot. Back in 2009, Phil was found guilty of second-degree murder for the death of actress Lana Clarkson. This conviction happened in a second trial after the first one was deadlocked in 2007. Phil ended up being sentenced to 19 years to life in prison and was eligible for parole hearing in 2025. Phil, who was born Harvey Philip Spector in 1939, is known for revolutionizing rock and pot music in the 1960s with his layered wall of sound production technique. During his career, Phil has produced music for legendary bands and artists such as The Beatles, The Ramones, and even Cher."}

So I guess just talk to us a little bit about what just happened after passing out after finishing that. Okay, so I had a single episode. I have a history of having an overactive vagal response. And so with that, if I have pain from anything, hangnail or fasal my toe, I can just pass out. So what happened is I started getting, I get an aura before of feeling weak, dizzy, disoriented, and it just hit me all of a sudden. Just felt really di-phoretic and I could feel it coming on. So I felt a little disoriented, but I feel fine now. And the pain in my arm is very minimal actually, but it doesn't take much. So you feel fine now? I feel fine now. And this is, you know, I have passed out probably six times in the past six weeks. You know, it's common for me. No regret taking the vaccine? No, no. I mean, like I said, a hangnail can cause me to have this. So this is common for your arms? It is for me, yes. Yes. Typically, like I said, I can feel it coming on and I could, but I was trying to push through, but, you know. Thank you. Oh yeah, thank you so much. Around to be monitored for a few minutes. One of those is in case you have an allergic reaction that's exceptionally rare with any vaccine, but theoretically possible. So we recommend being on the safe side with that. If people have a history of having hypersensitivity reactions, not of an allergic nature, but getting nervous or getting a little bit lightheaded after a painful stimulus, sometimes just sitting down for 10 minutes before getting back up is advisable and can prevent this kind of thing from happening. Because transiently the blood pressure can just lower a little bit, basically just from an increased vagal tone to the nervous system. So what do you think was the case here? I think that she got a shot in the arm and made her feel a little bit lightheaded and she's recovered now. It's happened before apparently. Okay, so this is normal behavior for this person? It is a reaction that can happen very frequently with any vaccine, with a shot of any kind. There's no reason to be concerned with the vaccine. Kind of like if you've been to the doctor and had blood work done before, some people get a little lightheaded when they see the needle going into their skin. This is the identical kind of reaction. Yeah, no reason to suspect that that's due to the vaccine whatsoever. But if you're afraid of needles or have a history of getting a little bit worked up or sensitive around needles, take a minute afterwards and catch your breath. Sit down, have somebody fan you a little bit, take a drink of water. For people who have diabetes and are on insulin or have a predisposition to getting low blood sugar, having a little bit of glucose in the form of a cookie or cracker or something can help too because sometimes hypoglycemia can present this way as well. But just sitting down and taking a minute before going about your day."}

We mark today with a ceremony of remembrance, solidarity, and hope. Through the words of our tradition, with the guidance and love of several of our diverse Jewish communities' spiritual leaders, may we draw strength and inspiration from those who've come before us as we invoke the guidance and presence of the Divine. Fear cannot be the driver of our life. Instead, we need to lead with chesed, with love, with generosity, with compassion, resilience, and hope. And I think it is critically important that the federal government recognize the role that it plays and make sure again that that support is cascading down through various ways through which we can call attention to it and fund programs to combat it. So just because of what I talk about, these issues of course have affected me and my family. But I remember what my mom told me when I was nine years old. She said, stand up for something even if it means sacrificing everything. And that's what I'm trying to do. The history between the NAACP and the ADL is critically important for us all to understand. The NAACP and the ADL have walked in lockstep in the pursuit of freedom for all people, the right of all of us to be self-determinative, and in the quest for the dignity of every human being. And so today, now more than ever, I believe that it is critically important for us to continue that legacy. We have to become the unwelcome guest at the dinner table. And not just for the young people at the table, but to telegraph the message that this is not acceptable. But I think that if anything good can come from this moment, it's for us to think about the fact that Jewish history is written in the present. We are writing our chapter of Jewish history. I thought that it was a very powerful experience, and I've been looking forward to this for a while. I'm probably going to go back to campus and continue to fight the fight against anti-Semitism and not back down and stay strong. Fighting anti-Semitism must be, it must be one of our priorities in the work to create justice, inclusivity, equity, safety and security. So we are in this fight together. Thank you for being here."}

In chapter 266, halukheh 3, 4, 5 and 6, he describes how the circumcision is to be done. This is after the cutting. The moho does what is called m'thitsa. M'thitsa means to suck and it means doing so with this mouth. One could say, well, why can't you use a tube? Well, you could, technically, but it's not the custom as to how it was done. Now, why is it that way? Well, you could say that in the old days you didn't have tubes, now you can have tubes, so why not? One of the features I thought about it is that it's not as effective because the tube does not seal as well, it's not as pliable, and furthermore, it's not as quick and it's not as close. You have to have a quick suction action, you have to have more pliability, and also there's a theory, some people feel that it is, some people feel that it's not, that the saliva of a human being has some antiseptic qualities, and it's actually brought in the halakh of the Talmud that the saliva of certain people were actually used as curatives. And so saliva is not a bad thing, saliva has elements of cleaning, of antiseptic elements within it, and the other part of it is that the suction process of the mouth is quicker, more pliable, and it's more exact, and works much better.

You should work towards becoming prime minister of Israel one day. Maybe we can have like an alt-right prime minister of Israel one day. With this rhetoric, I don't know if I could. They discovered this interview one day in all my publications. With the exception of maybe Iran and the Russian aid to Assad, we are the regional hegemony in terms of military. We're a very small country. We could flatten half the Middle East in an offensive onslaught tomorrow. I'm gonna do it. No, that's not a smart thing to do. Not necessarily. But also you have like people talk about we're genociding the Palestinians. You know, I think we've shown immense restraint. And we could genocide them tomorrow. You know, we could go in and flatten Gaza tomorrow with our fighter jets. But we don't do it. So it's obviously immoral. I don't believe in genocide. But I do believe in expulsion because I think it actually would be better for everyone involved. And nationalism, this is why we need our separate countries."}

Contact 5 investigator Maris Badcock joins us to explain. Maris. An attorney representing some of Jeffrey Epstein's victims says he personally knows of several young women who were allowed to visit Epstein while he was on work release here in Palm Beach County in 2008. The women claim they were solicited for sexual favors by Epstein while he was on work release at a downtown West Palm Beach office and he was being monitored by PBSO deputies at the time. Now this was a benefit afforded to the convicted sex offender while he was incarcerated from 2008 to 2009 on one charge of procuring prostitution from a minor. Now part of the plea deal that is this is all part of a plea deal that has made headlines since his recent arrest in New York on federal new charges. Information that we've received from victims including at least one who personally visited him was that it was not for some business arrangement and it was for if you were in jail improper sexual contact. Now the Sheriff's Office says that's not true. A spokeswoman tells me Epstein was quote quote carefully guarded and allowed no friends or family or guests. She says there are 464 records which back this up. We've been asking for those records along with a visitor log from the Sheriff's Office and we're waiting on a response. Back to you. Maris."}

They're saying that this massive document dump is going to be imminent and that the associates of this man should prepare for the worst. Some people that have been caught going to his places have been trying to deny any association with him. Trying to say, yeah, well, I know him may have went there just to say hi or hang out once or twice was invited, but nothing, you know, bad went down. But that's what many say when other things have happened behind the curtain. And this is why he is finally getting taken down. A lot of people are nervous because they feel that this is ultimately going to lead to a lot of names being dropped. Now let me remind everybody, if you don't recall, this is a big one. Don't forget this. Bill Clinton's name keeps getting brought up, right? But you have got to remember that the judge overseeing this whole thing was appointed by Bill Clinton. Don't forget that. It's pretty key in this whole thing. So go back to Acosta that just said he was stepping down. Acosta was supposed to prosecute Epstein and gave him a very lenient sentence last time and when they asked him, why did you do this? His answer was that he belonged to intelligence. That's what he was told. He was reportedly told that Epstein belonged to intelligence. That is interesting as well. I will update on this Friday night underground world news live.

According to the paper, the conference will feature speeches by Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as well as by Trump's National Security Advisor, John Bolton. His special envoy to the Middle East, Jason Greenblatt, and his ambassador to Israel, David Friedman. The annual summit, held in Washington, D.C., will take place today and tomorrow, attracting thousands of evangelical Christians from across the U.S. Other speakers at the event include Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida, Roy Blunt of Missouri and Tim Scott of South Carolina. Although Koufai describes itself as bipartisan organization, no Democratic senators are scheduled to speak. According to Haritz, the decision to send senior administration officials to the Koufai gathering is, no coincidence, since evangelicals are a key voting block for Trump and the Republicans. Around 80 percent of white evangelicals voted for Trump in 2016, helping him secure victories in several swing states. The paper stated, The consensus among U.S. political analysts is that the president will need similar or greater support among evangelicals to win a second term next year. When the Trump administration relocated the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, Koufai founder Texas pastor John Hagee gave a speech at the opening ceremony, declaring, There has never been a more pro-Israeli president than Donald Trump. The paper added that for Trump, the support of the overwhelming majority of white evangelicals, those who voted for him in 2016 and who love his Israel policies, is crucial. According to recent reports, the president's reelection campaign will seek to mobilize even more evangelical voters. This article originally appeared on Middle East Monitor."}

Currently home to Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site, the location has been long contested between the two religions. The Jewish group however maintains that the location is key for fulfilling biblical prophecies. It is a new start of the redemption and we hope the text here or even before will be on the Temple Mount. The law will come from here. All the 17 nations, they will have a seat in the court and the law will be the law of the Bible. On a rainy day before Passover, the organization gathers on a rooftop in the old city to carry out a controversial practice. Ritual sacrifice. Under the watch of high security, the sheep is brought to a secluded area. Religious followers continue to make final preparations. We're on another milestone in the process of the return of the Jewish people to their homeland. Young men playing the role of priests dress in biblical looking clothes. It's now time to begin. Everyone gathers to pray as the priests re-enact ancient traditions from the Bible. The event that takes place here is not an event in itself. It's a practice. It's a training. And people are coming here to learn, to understand. Out of the eye of the public, the sheep is slaughtered. Its blood is brought out for ritual use. And maybe this year, four days later, the representative of the groups of the Israelis will come with their lamb to the yards of the temple. We built a kosher altar and start all the ritual of Pesach lambs. To complete the sacrifice, the lamb is skinned and displayed for the group. The body is cooked to be eaten later that night."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_580", "transcript": "In a five-year period, 122 workers died, Thai workers, in the Israeli agricultural sector. I was at a Moxab the day after a worker died and asleep. He'd been working 17 hours a day, seven days a week, and he'd been given four days off per year. In all the cases that we encounter until now that a Thai worker had died in his sleep, nobody went to actually check how many hours he worked in that day, what kind of accommodation they had if he was spraying or not spraying pesticides. What concerns us greatly is whether or not these living and working conditions are contributing to the very problematic pattern of death. There are approximately 25,000 Thai workers in Israel right now, almost exclusively doing all the work in Israel's agricultural sector. Since 2011, when Israel signed a bilateral agreement with the government of Thailand, it's only been Thai workers who've been coming in. We need them for our economy. The far away we shut their field and shut their business if they don't have workers. And only foreign workers come to work in agriculture. So we have to treat them as our guests and to take care of them. When we visit these workers, you keep finding the same problems. Workers living in really squalid accommodation. Before he was stopped, they put in chemical and motor and everything he kept inside. The farmer would usually just let the workers live in the cheapest place he can find. His old packaging house, his old warehouses, his old chicken houses. It's usually in the backyard of every big villa in every village. If we go to the toilet, we go to the outside under the tree. So there was no toilet, no toilet. Thirty year old, forty year old men and women that are here to work for five years and three months is supposed to be their home. And none of the farmers and me or any Knesset member will allow their kids to sleep in these places. We conducted a survey among 500 workers. No one was getting minimum wage. Workers have to spray pesticides. Many of the workers we spoke to were clearly not given adequate protection when they did that. In the summer when it's outside, you can get up to 35, 40 degrees and then in there it gets up to 60 degrees. It's very, very hard to breathe in this situation. The workers are working incredibly long hours in incredible heat. And in some cases there's this great concern that workers may in fact be being worked to death. The employer is fully aware that the likelihood of any prosecution for unviolating workers' rights is very low. So if he wants to make a worker work for 20 hours a day, he can. When you have excellent laws in place, you have the perception that this is a very well regulated sector. But if those laws aren't properly enforced, then you move quickly to a very badly regulated sector. They come here for five years, they leave their families, they leave their kids and they deserve to be treated properly, to be treated according to the law. And they deserve not to be subjected to living and working conditions that place their lives at risk."}

The reality is that more than 99% of the men and women that put on the uniform of law enforcement every day are the very best of us, Barbara.

{"vid": "non_hate_video_599", "transcript": "And that applies to Jews as well as anybody else. So strongly identified Jews tend to have strongly positive views in their in-group, strongly negative views of the outsiders. And that's part of the culture of critique. These Jewish intellectuals have very negative views about the culture and peoples of the outside them. One of the questions about the spread of the Frankfurt School of Ideology in the United States and especially in universities is how they jumped so quickly from being a handful of people in key universities to dominating the university system. It was their presence throughout the system. While Boasian anthropology was spread by a careful process of the development of cadres and placing them in key positions over the course of a generation, the Frankfurt School very quickly came to ascendancy all across American higher education. And this has always remained kind of a mystery, but I think part of the mystery is explained by the role of the new school for social research and its agenda, which was to credential Jewish refugees from Europe before, during and after World War II. These people were credentialed in a very pro forma manner. Very few of them did anything like what we would consider coursework. They were simply given advanced degrees. They turned out torrents of PhDs and moreover this was part of a broader stream of European Jews, many with phony credentials coming into the United States at the very moment of the largest expansion of the American university system in its history, which was during the GI Bill after World War II. Suddenly there was a need for thousands of new professors. And these could not be conservatives because they were still politically risky after World War II, but Jews were considered to be morally pure because of their terrible suffering and their credentials were never looked at too closely. Suddenly there were thousands, tens of thousands of new professors and they all held this ideology, which was an ideology that was based on advancing their own interests."}

And against the modern anti-Semitism. As a Hungarian, I am asking forgiveness for our silence. I am so sorry that something like this could happen. We also ask your physicians for the passion to join your family 15 years ago, on March 1968. We have rejected them at the border. As a representative of the Swiss government and the Swiss policy, I admit our nation's guilt. It is a result of this. I stand here as the granddaughter of a man who helped build this camp. He helped to set up the gas chambers. I am standing here today and with all my heart I would like to ask your forgiveness. We ask forgiveness for sheltering the Nazis who had fled to Argentina for protecting them rather than handing them over. No more anti-Semitism. Marches of Life are taking place all over the world. In every city, in every country, every year on Yomashua, an active voice against anti-Semitism and a voice of friendship with Israel. Raise your voice and be a light. United to be a light.

{"vid": "non_hate_video_602", "transcript": "In early 17th century Florence, almost all financial cases that came before the magistrates in the police court involved Jews. Not many, not most, but almost all. I couldn't believe it either, but I spent years going through the Florentine police records. And this wasn't the sad old story of police persecution. The suits were usually initiated by the Jews themselves. Debt collection was an intensely adversarial process, and the usual method was to force a settlement by having the Christian defaulter arrested and jailed, and on rare occasions Jews had Jewish debtors imprisoned as well. Not nice. Not kosher either, as a matter of fact."}
{"vid": "non_hate_video_603", "transcript": "So let's look at, we're going to transition now from looking at just symbolism to looking at word play. And this is something that many people won't get because they're too left-brained, imbalanced, and can't see the dynamic of what is known as green language. Or, if you want to look this up, look up the language of the birds. This is alchemical pun language. It is not meant to be taken 100% totally literally, nor even as the direct intent of the people who came up with a specific word. It could also be an example of synchromysticism working itself out in the universe to bring certain things to our attention. And we need to be conscious enough to recognize the pattern. This is why the alchemist called it the language of the birds. It's something you have to be quiet to hear. You have to have a balanced brain to be able to interpret or read this language. It is verbal, but it is verbal and symbolic simultaneously. Green language, which we left off talking about last week, is symbolic word pun or word play language. This does not necessarily have to be deliberately constructed by the person who constructed any given language. It seems that this type of word pun language, which is called either alchemical language or green language, it is also sometimes referred to as the language of the birds. And this is another pun because it's the language of bards, of people who are coming forward using their voice to speak truths into creation. So green language or alchemical language, first of all, does not have to be deliberately intended. It could be, as I mentioned last week, an example of what is known as synchromysticism, which is the seemingly mundane is somehow speaking to us through language, through symbol, sometimes through art."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_606", "transcript": "In my adopted religious tradition of Judaism, people have responsibility, have agency after the age of 13. So 13 year old girls, 13 year old boys are regarded in Judaism as being responsible for their actions. So if I take Torah seriously, I have to regard all the girls that I've read about in the Jeffrey Epstein stories that I've read in the Miami Herald as having agency as being responsible for their choices. I have not read anything about Jeffrey Epstein and his procurers forcing people at gunpoint to perform sexual acts. All I've ever seen is grooming and the paying of money and the giving of gifts to entice girls who generally seem, as far as I remember, to be over, to be 13 years of age or older, they've been performing sexual favors for money. So just thinking out loud, to me, they are responsible for their choices. They were over the age of 13, they took money to do these deeds. That doesn't let Jeffrey Epstein off the hook, just as if I facilitate some kind of illicit or immoral arrangement with elsewhere. I still bear some responsibility, but I certainly don't view a 13 year old girl who takes money for performing sex acts as having no agency. I'm just curious what the rest of the panel believe. Do you think that a 13, 14, 15, 16 year old girl who takes money for performing sex acts bears no responsibility? Does she have no moral agency? Look, their age of consent loss in the United States. Furthermore, the interstate transportation, that is the transportation of a woman under a certain age, across state lines, whether by vehicle or airplane, for the purpose of prostitution, is a felony. We do not believe that children, 14 year old is still a child, is not capable of giving informed consent. That's why it's against the law to have sexual relations with a 13 or 14 year old. Well, it depends on the locale. So age of consent do vary. Also, there's no necessary connection between legality and morality. I was speaking morality. I was not speaking legality. So in some states, sex with a 14 year old is permitted. In other states, the person has to be 18. The morality doesn't change. Only the legality changes. And throughout Western history, it's been quite common for 13, 14, 15, 16 year olds to get married. So anyone else want to weigh in on this topic? Look, that's a suspicious argument for the reason that children are protected in a way that they were not protected in the past. It was not unusual in the past for, say, 16 year old girls to be married off and then to work as farmers' wives for the rest of their lives. That's not the way it works now. And as a matter of fact, there is no age of consent in the 50 states of the United States below the age of 16. Brondle, if your teacher had given you a blowjob when you were 14, would you, your female teacher, would you have regarded yourself as irreparably damaged and completely lacking in agency? Will Durant, the philosopher, by the way, fell in love with his wife when she was 14. So they were together since she was age of 14. And also the leader of France, Emmanuel Macron, fell in love with his teacher when he was what, 14, 15 years of age. And what a wonderful relationship that has turned out to be. You threatened those children, didn't you? That's not the way it happened. You told them to lie, to falsely claim that Mr. Getty's had hurt them. These things did happen. Because if they didn't go along, you were going to tell everyone about this special party. They happened to me. So you made up a story, a special story, a story about a math teacher who was tough on you, who kept you after class, a huge hog beast you didn't like. That's what really happened, isn't it? No, I didn't want to be the only one."}

The afternoon prayer and everyday custom inside the Elnor Mosque for Muslims like Muhammad Ismail and ordinary ritual in an extraordinary place. Even today when we sit down I can hear the sound of the gun in my ears. On that Friday of March the 15th they were on their knees like this facing Mecca, their backs turned to the gunman. We heard this sound like a light cracking or something like that you know so everybody What position were you in? We were just sitting down like that. All I did was look back like that. This room was full of the faithful. This room was also full with women and children. The gunman marching down the hallway to kill. Being here the reality is they were just so so vulnerable. All we could see was the smoke in the three gunshots. Blood shed and chaos unleashed. When you were lying you know when you hear these gunshots you know the smell of gun powder that was really frightening. I can feel the winds sort of you know I could have been the bullets going over my head. Mohammad Ishmael caught in our stampede. There I was you know exactly this place on the side.

This is much more than a monster him because he is actually one of the community leaders who helped create this place. One of three community leaders who came up with the idea who raised the money who found the land and actually built this so that people could come. Mohammad Ishmael the thought of him having to be forced to escape out of here was friends were killed around him as he prayed in his favorite spot and scrambled over a tiny little tree. I'm sure everybody would agree is just playing wrong.

{"vid": "non_hate_video_609", "transcript": "Are you in control of your mind or are others? When we choose to watch television, go to the movies, listen to pop music, read certain books, and consume other forms of toxic culture, we see at least partial control of our systems, as we do not have the proper firewalls in place to deal with all of the overt and covert messages. Subliminals, predictive programming, and emotional triggers are put into media to change your thinking and therefore your actions. For far too long, others have projected their will upon us, often through the use of literal projection screens. So it's important to realize how easily we are affected by electromagnetic manipulation, especially as recent developments have led to mind control technology that can project voices inside your head. Don't believe me? Look it up. Imagine a war of the world scenario that does not actually involve radio, but holograms, nanotech, and mass mind control technology. Mind control is not all that hard to achieve, even using simple means. In order to demonstrate this, I am going to perform an experiment with you all. I know this might seem a bit silly, but please do bear with me. I need your participation in order for this to be effective. First, please think of a stuffed purple elephant, like Barney, but with big ears and a long trunk. Now I want you to touch your nose with your right pointer finger, and I'm not testing to see if you're drunk. Don't worry. Keep it there for three seconds. One, two, three. Now, maybe I did not get you all to touch your finger to your nose, but I did get you to think of an elephant version of Barney, didn't I? Through the vibratory waves of my voice and my moving image, I was able to fire certain neurons in your brain, creating a mental image, and initiating a cascade of electrical signals that likely resulted in your finger moving exactly how I wanted it to move. This is just a very simple experiment to show how one person is able to use their power to influence others. You are far more powerful and influential than you might think. You are actually a being of great luminosity. An easy way to show this is with one of those stationary bikes hooked up to a light bulb. Through just a little bit of effort, you are able to take the energy stored inside you and light up a dark room. Hopefully, there is a light bulb going off in your head as you start to realize the implications of this all. Your power goes far beyond the boundaries of your skin, your bioelectric field, or the life energy some call chi, extends beyond your material body, as can be seen visually with Curly and Photography. Another good way to demonstrate how you can influence others from a distance is through the use of your voice. You can talk to someone on the other side of the room and get in their head, or shout and raise an alarm that is heard for miles. When you consider how we are able to use the internet now to utilize our voice around the world, this really is a power that we should not underestimate. Even just your presence, the sight of you, perhaps your powerful smile, or your glare, can have a profound effect upon others at a distance. Let us regain control of our minds, realize our power, increase it, and use our influence to awaken and activate as many other people as possible. We need to break the spell we have been under once and for all. Let us expose and overthrow the dark sorcerers who have been ruling over us for far too long."}

This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9-11 moment only. It's not going to be localized. It's going to be happening all over the country. I want America to understand that. The White House anticipates a death toll in the US of between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans. The Surgeon General said the mitigation efforts of the population, including in many places staying at home and so-called social distancing, was helping to curb the spread of the coronavirus. He urged the nine states that do not have statewide stay-at-home orders to implement some short-term mechanism to help curb the spread of the coronavirus, if only temporarily to free up parts of the healthcare system. In recent weeks, the message from President Donald Trump in his daily press briefings has been that the White House has this situation under control. But Sunday, we heard another version of that from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. We are struggling to get it under control, and that's the issue that's at hand right now. The thing that's important is that what you see is increases in new cases, which then start to flatten out. But the end result of that, you don't see for days, if not weeks, down the pike. Further, Dr. Fauci worried that the coronavirus could become seasonal. He said that there was a very small chance that the coronavirus would be completely contained or completely eliminated. So once this crisis dies down, it could come roaring back later this year or next year, and that pattern could be repeated until a vaccine is found. Tobey Mus, CGTN, Washington."}

Yeah Since Sunday evening we took over this compound This is international territory When you step outside, it's US Here is international territory, this is your compound The United Nations claims to be the champion of your human rights Here they are boasting about how they love the freedom of the press But notice that in the UN Declaration of Human Rights They claim the power to deny you any of your rights At their discretion if it doesn't fit their agenda There were thousands of cameras filming the United Nations that day Activists, journalists and citizens But as soon as their security saw that one activist Was speaking against the UN's agenda She was targeted Just like the UN's Declaration on Human Rights says that they have a loophole for Let's recap what you just saw The UN set up a compound in the middle of Salt Lake City The UN says they took over the building The UN stated that the taxpayer funded Salt Lake Palace Was now international territory where US rights don't apply The UN stated that the United States was outside the doors of the Salt Palace And the UN, who at best should have been a guest of Salt Lake Instead acted like an invader and denied a US citizen their first amendment rights Should the United Nations be allowed to simply claim territory in the middle of the United States And deny any US citizen any of their nameable rights The evidence is clear that the UN's claims of defending human rights is a complete farce They have demonstrated their intent to rule along with their complete lack of respect for our own citizens For all to see, right here on our own soil That's not all, but this has all been brought to you by your fellow elected leaders And other prominent Utah officials The Utah legislature actually paid for them to come here And defended this international compound with your tax dollars The mayor of Salt Lake City welcomed them with open arms And the executives of Utah Valley University invited them here Shortly after they officially signed up to promote the UN's agenda through the university Do you know that the United Nations is already writing and passing laws But the state of Utah and Utah's cities are putting into law on behalf of the UN If you're upset that the Utah legislature and the city of Salt Lake invited this organization To come and trample on your rights, please go right now to UnitedNationsUtah.com And sign the petition, and then share this video on all of your social media Don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel for more bombshell reports about the United Nations in Utah And what you can do to take back your local government"}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_626", "transcript": "Children had only just started to head back to school in France, but after only one week of classes around 70 are having to shut down once more as cases of Covid-19 have been detected. It is probably a virus that was contracted before returning to school after exiting confinement. We'll see what the analyses say. This is what many teachers and their unions had warned about. They implored the government not to reopen schools, fearing that they could become hotspots for the transmission of the virus. Parents had also been raising their own concerns. They've been asking us if we want to send the kids back and, you know, have mixed feelings. Everything just opened up. So we're actually sort of continuing as we were for a few weeks to see what happens in the next three weeks. I personally think we're going to end up back in lockdown. I don't feel like everything's opened up, though, because the danger is gone. I think everything has opened up because financially they can't afford to keep it closed and because people are losing their minds. But I think it was also opened up because now if a whole lot of people get ill there are beds and ventilators. Though many measures were put in place to stop the virus spreading, it appears that they just weren't enough. The government insists the schools that are closing down again are only a small percentage overall. And it says the consequences of children not going to school are more serious. However, while the number of children who've contracted Covid-19 is relatively small, there is another alarming trend that's been emerging. Last week, France registered the first case of a child dying from a rare complication linked to coronavirus. The child presented symptoms resembling Kawasaki disease, the serological test done within the pediatric ICU unit, indicated that he had been in contact with the coronavirus without developing the symptoms the prior week. It's a rare inflammatory disease that normally affects children under the age of five. But since the Covid pandemic, children across the world have been showing similar symptoms. In France, there have been more than 100 reported cases since the beginning of March. At present, parents in France can decide whether or not to send their children back to school. But given these new cases of Covid-19 centred around reopened schools and the surge in more complex cases involving children, many parents just may decide that it is still too risky.

{"vid": "non_hate_video_634", "transcript": "Molly Conlin, a child actor turned to Instagram model, was recently held at Knife Point while Thugs raided her home. She wrote about the situation on Twitter, quote, So I didn't know whether to write a post or not, but my mom's saying it's the best thing to do, as you never know if it is going to happen to you. At 3 o'clock today, I was in my house when I got a knock on the door. I opened it thinking it was a delivery man. Two tall black men barged in, pushed me to the ground, dragged me upstairs and held me at Knife Point while raiding my house. I was literally praying as I thought I was going to die. Little did I know, two had come through the back of my house also and found my brother's car keys and later all jumped into his black Audi A1 and took my phone and a watch. They were screaming at me, telling me they was going to hurt me if I didn't give them anything while I was begging for my life being pinned down to the floor. When I called the police for my neighbor's phone, they come and later found my phone ditched and crescent. Please, can everyone lock their front doors as I see this happen on Facebook the other day and never thought this would happen to me. End quote. On her Twitter profile, she regularly demonizes the police and she retweeted someone who was ridiculing white women for not wanting the police to be abolished. Then two weeks later she was begging for her life and ran to her neighbor's house crying for the police. As I've said before, liberal women are mentally sick. They want to abolish the police, but the moment a man takes advantage of them, they cry for the police. These type of women end up learning the hard way and Molly's case is a great example. During 2018 in the United States, 59,778 blacks were violently victimized by whites, whereas 547,948 whites were violently victimized by blacks. The fact is, blacks commit almost 10 times more interracial violent crimes against whites, yet what does Molly have to say about this? She tweeted, no lives matter until black lives matter. What happened a couple weeks after she wrote that? Black men barged into her home and she was begging for her life. This is poetic justice. And you know what the greatest irony of all this is? A group of black men raided her home and held her at a knife point, similar to how George Floyd's friends raided a pregnant woman's home while he held her at gunpoint, aiming the gun at her stomach. Molly felt the exact pain that George Floyd's victim felt that day, and I'm not trying to kick her while she's down. I do think she can become a wiser person after this. For example, her Twitter header was a photo of black lives matter. After being assaulted she replaced it. Good on her."}
{"vid": "non_hate_video_635", "transcript": "It's been one month since activists in Washington, D.C. painted Black Lives Matter on a street not far from the White House with the blessing of the district government. Now the conservative nonprofit Judicial Watch is suing the city's mayor Muriel Bowser and others citing a First Amendment violation after their request to paint a political message was denied. Judicial Watch President Tom Hitton joins me now. Tom, what did you want to paint on the street? Well, it's our motto at Judicial Watch. It's our motivation because no one is above the law. It doesn't get any more apolitical than that. We wanted to paint it on a street near our offices here on Capitol Hill just a few blocks away from the studio. And the mayor and her office gave us the run around for three weeks. So we sued. Now, remember, the city painted Black Lives Matter. The city also allowed to be painted as well defund the police. So it's hard to argue that that can take place, yet a request like we're making can't. And so when you start denying access to a public forum now, which the streets are, according to the mayors, own actions, you're running up against the First Amendment. That's why we're in federal court. I want to read to you part of a response from a George Washington University professor, Paul Schiff Berman. He writes, if you create a true public forum and you let lots of people protest there, then of course the government can't favor some sorts of speech over other sorts of speech. But this is not a public park. This is the government itself choosing to speak. The government painted the Black Lives Matter painting on the street. And when the government is speaking, they're not required to allow space for alternative viewpoints. I find that point of view a little surprising, since when is the government always right? Well, especially since they allowed that group to paint defund the police. Look, you know, we asked if go through the rule. We promised to go through the rules, say, you know, if we need a permit, we'll get the permit. If we need paint, we'll buy the paint. We'll do everything necessary to comply with the law to get this message there. And the government obviously can have certain restrictions about how it's done. They initially said, well, I don't know if it will work because it might interfere with traffic. I said, well, you know, let's, we can close the street. Is there a way to get a street closed? There's a street that's closed now outside the White House, evidently, to protect this painting. Can we get an option there? And we're just getting the run around. We were told to call to deal with their permitting office. They said, well, we don't know anything about a permit like that. And it's not just in D.C. We've warned up in New York City. We've warned Mayor de Blasio, who's also planning to paint similar messages across the city. We want access to, we want to paint on Fifth Avenue. What's to prevent, I don't know, somebody from coming in and saying, okay, now this week you need to paint Native American Lives Matter on the streets of Washington, D.C.? Nothing. But this is the consequence when a government or starts playing games. And you know, if they're going to start picking winners and losers on speech issues, informs they're now opening up to the American people, the result is they got to follow the law. And we're trying to hold the government accountable to the law. It looks to me like the D.C. Mayor doesn't want our message to be out there because she disagrees with it. And that's not proper under the Constitution. All right, Tom Fitton, you have hit a roadblock so far with the city, but let us know the outcome of your suit. Thanks for coming on. We'll do it. Thanks, Scott. Thanks, Scott. Thanks, Scott. Thanks, Scott. Thanks, Scott. Thanks, Scott. Thanks, Scott. Thanks, Scott. Thanks, Scott. Thanks, Scott. Thanks, Scott. Thanks, Scott."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_637", "transcript": "Arno McAllister knows better than most the mind of a far right-wing white supremacist. He says he was one. I had been violent since I was a little kid and hate was just like another part of the rush. And that's who I was when I heard white power skinhead music that told me the reason I was violent and the reason I was hateful is because I was a white warrior. In the late 80s, McAllister was a founding member of what became the largest racist skinhead organization in the world. He was also the lead singer of a white power metal band. McAllister left his life of hate behind in 1994 after becoming a single parent. A second friend of mine was shot and killed in a street fight after a concert my band had played and by that point I had lost count of how many friends had went to prison. So it finally hit me that if I didn't change my ways, death or incarceration was going to take me from my daughter. But his past would soon come back to haunt him. In 2012, a white supremacist, someone who had joined the gang that McAllister formed, went to this Sikh temple on the outskirts of Milwaukee and shot seven people dead. As I'm going to the temple that morning, we started to get notifications that there was a white supremacist inside the temple and at that time I knew that both my parents were inside. My deep Kaleika's father and the president of the temple, Satwant Singh Kaleika, was among those that died. Six weeks after the attack, Kaleika contacted McAllister, looking for answers. The meeting proved to be fruitful. The pair realized they could work together to help find solutions to hate. They decided to form SURF to unite, a group that works to divert young people away from violent extremist ideologies. The habit of white supremacy is not going to be easy for us to change. And it's going to take these tectonic plates to really shift and move. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center's annual year in hate and extremism report, the number of hate groups has increased by 55 percent since 2017. Going by the definition that hate is a willful denial of compassion, the answer to hate, I believe, is compassion."}
