{"vid": "hate_video_24", "transcript": "Okay, I strongly recommend that you read this article in the V Dare magazine. I have the link below. It basically talks about two things. One is, of course, the average IQ of blacks is 85 compared to whites, which is about 100. It's actually 103. Now keep in mind that 85 versus 100, it's not like 15% less. IQ tests are based on algorithms, which means that the number is much bigger than you realize. In other words, it's not that you're beating someone by 15 yards in 100 yards dash. You're beating someone by like 60 yards in 100 yards dash if your IQ, let's say, is 100 points and your opponent is 85. So 85 is vastly inferior, is really borderline retarded compared to whites. And then the article goes on to talk about the fact that this is all genetic. You can't do anything about it. They try to put blacks in better educational environment, put blacks that are raised by white couples. It's the same situation. Blacks IQ will be lower and they will show all those traits normally associated with being of African descent. Also the personality, they talk about the personality traits of blacks. One is called conscientiousness, impulse control issue, extraversion, feeling positive feeling strongly and taking risks. Agreeableness, altruism and empathy, which of course blacks lack. Blacks don't have any empathy or altruism. They see a victim on the side of the street, you know, somebody and you see the videos, you know, somebody who's drunk, let's say, or somebody drops dead of a heart attack, they're not going to help them. They're going to riffle through their pockets to grab their wallets or whatever other possession they have. And last but not least is neuroticism, neuroticism, feeling negative, feeling strongly and thus being mentally unstable. It's a trait of blacks that they seem to be obsessed with certain particular topics like, for instance, white racism. Research has also showed that blacks have negative ethnocentrism more than any other group, certainly more than whites. They have strong negative feelings toward every other race. Black racism is way more than any other group in the world. You know, they are safe in our in a white neighborhood, but whites or anybody else for them is not safe in a black neighborhood. They will be assaulted. I will do a video on that one another time. They will be assaulted if you are of another group and you walk through their neighborhoods. We all know that. We all know that. You liberals know that. And so I recommend that you read this article. Let me add also that blacks also have what is known as the basic four percent out of disorders, which are really linked to the idea that blacks are like children in adult bodies. Paranoia, aggression, dependency and narcissism. Excuse me, paranoia, aggression, dependency and narcissism. These are all traits of children by which blacks never seem to recover. And this are particularly bad because this is the reason why, of course, you know, you have crime, you have serial killers, mass shooters, etc. Racially motivated crimes are all the result of this personality disorder. I agree with most of it in the sense that I would add more to it."}

I'd take them up a salm and let the white man pay. If I could be a nigger for a day. Now for one whole day, a nigger I could be. The first thing I do is join the NAACP and I'd let Fuyzi and Fumay do my thinking for me. If I could be a nigger for a day. Now it wouldn't want to work because I wouldn't have to. Guess what I'd do next? You shouldn't need a clue. I'd go down to social services like all the brothers do. If I could be a nigger for a day. Oh, if I could be a nigger for a day. I could live my life the free and easy way. I'd take them up a salm and let the white man pay. If I could be a nigger for a day. Now when I'd sit down in that office, the office of welfare, I'd get food stamps, a medical card and free childcare. For all the little gentlemen kids that I've got scattered everywhere. If I could be a nigger for a day. Now I'd have plenty of time so I'd hang out with them all. And I'd consume a little dope, I'd find a good place to rob. Now that would make me self-employed and I wouldn't even need a job. If I could be a nigger for a day. Oh, if I could be a nigger for a day. I could live my life the free and easy way. I'd take them up a salm and let the white man pay. If I could be a nigger for a day. Now when I'd need something, I'd steal it, so I wouldn't have to buy it. And if the cops would apprehend me, you know that I'd deny it. If I could call Jesse or Al, they'd come start a riot. If I could be a nigger for a day. But I can't be a nigger, and I don't really have to be. Because coon, let me tell you, it's plain and simple to see. That if I was you for a day, then I'd be taking from me. So I don't want to be a nigger for a day. I don't want to be a nigger for a day. I don't want to live the free and easy way. I'll struggle long and struggle hard, but that's okay.

Here is a quick song I made for you. How long has the moon been in this rap game? Nowadays things just ain't the same, not enough kids down to kill the apes. Letting niggers in our schools, such a shame too many little wane wanes and drakes flotting the streets with purple drag. The moon is about to be fracked. Killing niggers is my middle name. Running over nigger bitches with a train and a monster truck to smash their brains and they've only got their selves to blame. You should end up in black too. Trigger a moon attack should have remained slaves in checks. Now the KKK coming from front and back with body bags called niggers sacks. Niggers aren't human check the facts. Building walls from dead niggers stacks. Tying monkey babies down in the middle of race tracks. How long do we have to wait? Until America is free again. Since niggers we ain't the same. They as well just change our name to niggerl and accept our wiggle friends. Liberals only like to pretend. So take the red pill kids. A part of the moon man regimen. How long do we gotta listen to feminism bitches get to the church of memenism? Every nigger or woman I'd just like killed at the numbers of verses I space over a billion. And how long until Mexicans return to hell? America is tired of them and you can tell. Donald Trump for president so ring the bell. Nasty wetbacks will dot or rot in a cell. How long until Aryan children can play outside? Without fear of spooks to make them dot. Nightmares about niggers make children cry. So make the filthy fucking animals fry. God sent me and I'm the sign. White profit dropping the bottom line. On a fire beat is where I ride. To end all dirty nigger lives. How long do we have to wait? Until America is free again. Since niggers we ain't the same. May as well just change our name to niggerl and accept our wiggle friends. Liberals only like to pretend. So take the red pill kids. A part of the moon man regimen. How long do we have to wait? Until America is free again. Since niggers we ain't the same. May as well just change our name to niggerl and accept our wiggle friends. Liberals only like to pretend. So take the red pill kids. A part of the moon man regimen. How long until we've completely eliminated? And all niggers have been illuminated. The KKK of today has only imitated. Only hesitated. Let our world become way too shaded. With black niggers until America was faded. But now triple K is here to save it. May bank and slay them. And no more niggers can fake us. Would be nationalists have only the greatest. And it's so heinous how liberals would want to hang us. Of all people we are the only ones. Who release top evil. Or even consider that Jewish propaganda might be see through. So stick with us through the up evil. And just watch as I get meaty evil. And all spooks get squashed like weevils. For niggers who don't know that's a type of evil. How long do we have to wait? Until America is free again. Since niggers we ain't the same. May as well just change our name to niggerl and accept our wiggle friends. So take the red pill kids. Apart of the Moonman regiment. How long do we have to wait? Until America is free again? Since niggers we ain't the same. May as well just change our name to mängerl and accept our wiggle friends. So take the red pill kids. Apart of the Moonman regiment. How long do we have to wait?

We are at war with feminist lies about patriarchy, rape culture and toxic masculinity. We are at war with treasonous Western leaders in Germany, France, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the once united Kingdom. In fact in every Western nation, except for the one where we are told the leader is a traitor who has committed treason against his own people. Donald Trump stands alone in support of Brexit. He stands alone in support of Western values. He stands alone in support of democracy. He stands alone in support of the freedom of speech.

The recent arrest, false imprisonment and effective torture of Tommy Robinson, Lauren Southern being banned from the United Kingdom and being threatened with arrest in Australia for committing the crime of wrong think in believing she was free to speak in a nation in which she actually is free to speak. Justin Trudeau giving millions of dollars to Islamic terrorists while giving nothing to injured Canadian soldiers. The once united kingdom locking people up for the crime, unbelievably, of throwing bacon at a mosque. A crime for which ultimately they died. Angela Merkel showing scorn and disdain for the German flag and even greater scorn and disdain for the German people. Her loathing of freedom. Her loathing of democracy. Her contempt for the safety of the German people. Her desperation to bring in hostile people from a hostile culture. Theresa May's cowardly, snivelling and pathetic refusal to implement the democratic will of the British people. Social media platforms shutting down, removing and shadow banning libertarian and conservative voices where anyone who refuses to toe the party line is turned into an Orwellian unperson. Leaders in Western nations taking large sums of money from the Chinese in what could only be described as bribes, skyrocketing national debt and ever increasing unemployment as a consequence of a series of bad trade deals that appear to be designed to harm their own people. Failing education systems driven by propaganda and ideology set out to indoctrinate rather than educate. The lie of 53 imaginary genders rammed down the throats of the young. Islamic grooming gangs being allowed to get away with raping thousands of children over a period of decades. The implementation in Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand have what amount to virtual blasphemy laws and laws prohibiting free speech in supposedly free nations. Lauren Southern and Stefan Mollinou being effectively banned from speaking in New Zealand. We are at war. This is an attack. This is an attack on Western culture and Western values. This is an attack on freedom and as we see in the rising body count from Islamic terror this is an attack on Western people. But the leaders of this attack are not the Islamists, they are the liars and the frauds and the con men who run our governments. We are at war. And our enemy is our treasonous leaders. But sadly they are aided and abetted by far too many of us who have bought the indoctrination and have bought the lies. We are at war. And we are losing.

I want to say double honor to the apostles and elders of great millstone that rule well and as always I want to give a sincere shalom to the house of David the elect. Alright, I'm the brother Zion and through the spirit I just wanted to give my quick take on the video that's going around. Alright concerning two edomites, okay two lowlife old pork chop shotgun having edomites alright that put up a live video on YouTube and claim they were going GMS Coon hunting. Okay? Now like one of the brothers was saying, I believe his name is Amawangabar, alright his channel is GMS Awakening, BAH144, I believe. Like he was saying, not one so called Coon was hunted that day, okay? No GMS members was confronted by those edomites man. Alright? And through the spirit and power of Yahweh, Bahashem, Yahweh Shai, you know we like edomites like that, okay? Edomites that are straightforward, you know they're not hiding who they are, okay? And like the elder down there in Dallas said, Elder Yahshuamah said, the Esau is hurt man, ultimately he's hurt, okay? And this proves that the edomites are not the Arabs man, a Salakia, yeah. Yeah, the edomites are not the Arabs, okay? Because you don't see Arabs doing things of that nature or having that type of behavior towards Jake, you know? Yeah, the Arabs had their part in the transatlantic slave trade and they set up their, you know, stores in your neighborhoods or have you would not but they don't have that attitude towards Jake like the so called white man does, okay? And that video was spiritual because you're gonna have a lot of edomites doing things like that man, okay? You're gonna have a lot of edomites doing things like that. Alright? Because this word is getting to Esau, what does it say in, as it is written in Hebrews 4 and 12 for the words of the most high as quick and powerful and sharper than any two edge sword, okay? So this word is getting to these devils man, this word has reached until the four corners of the earth, alright? And there's nothing Esau can do about it man. Only thing he can do is cry and complain, you know, and pretty soon he's gonna bring out his sword in the time of Jacob's trouble. He's gonna bring out the big guns but those were low level edomites anyway, you know? That claim that they believe in Jesus, sweet Jesus, alright? But that's what Esau did during the time of slavery man. He hated you, he had that perpetual hatred towards us in the name of what? Jesus man, okay? Not Yehahuah's shy but Jesus, alright? And that's why the apostle Paul said if any other, if they preach any other Jesus, alright? Because there is such thing as another Jesus man and that's Cheseray Borgir, that's not Yehahuah's shy of the Bible, alright? And not to get off topic, like I said, those two edomites, alright? I believe his name was Billy or Bob, something like that. Fucking Hill Billy, that's what he was, alright? You know, Esau's upset man and I just wanna say, you know, that video was spiritual, you know, it was very spiritual man. Because you don't see a video of these guys saying we're going IUIC, Coon Hunting or ISUPK, Coon Hunting, GOCC, Coon Hunting, you don't see videos like that. Why? Because those camps are not on fire like the Mennigrate Millstone, okay? And a lot of you Israelite camps, you don't even really push the destruction of America or the upcoming slavery of the edomites. A lot of you camps don't even push that man, you know? A lot of you camps don't push the downfall of our enemies, alright? So that proves that what, the men of great millstone, okay, we're the ones that's on fire and the men that's teaching our doctrine, the doctrine that we teach starting with the head apostles, we're the ones that's on fire for this word man, alright? So but you know what, that's just the beginning of things man, you know? The scripture say, for the love of many shall wax cold. So that's really just the beginning of what you're gonna start to see with these damn devils man. Alright? Because the time of Jacob's trouble is gonna approach very, very soon. And then you're gonna know who your enemies are man, then you're gonna know who's the damn devil that the Bible speaks of, who's the physical carnation of Satan on the planet earth man. Which is the edomites and it's not the Arabs, it's the so called white man, the Caucasian race today. Okay? The cave dwellers of the earth, the descendants of Esau Edom. Alright? And in the kingdom, guess what? We're gonna go Edomite hunting man, okay? And Esau's gonna be hunted down every single day, alright? Only break you're gonna get us on the Sabbath man. And soon as that sun, as soon as that sun go down on the Sabbath, we're gonna be right back on your asses man, right back on your ass. Okay? Just only rest you're gonna get man, cause you're gonna be in full hardcore slavery, full hardcore bondage man. You ain't gonna be no employees in the kingdom. You're gonna be slaves and your women are gonna be concubines and your daughters are gonna be concubines and your sons are gonna be slaves. Okay? That's say after the Bible, that's say after the holy Bible, that's say after the word of Yahweh, how about Hashem, Yahweh shy? Okay? But we know Esau's coming, you know?

{"vid": "hate_video_98", "transcript": "But, well, getting back into the subject of summer and summer stuff, here's something I was thinking about. Of course, you'll know about summer camps. You may have gone to a summer camp when you were a kid. However, I mean most Nigglets don't go to summer camps, I think, because their parents would rather spend the money on KRAG and KFC. But if we had summer camps exclusively for Nigglets, for example, what do you think they'd be like? I mean, in these PC times, you've got to tailor everything to each group, so I think it'd be fair to have summer camps just for Nigglets. So what would these camps be like? I think it would be like trying to get them in touch with their African roots. There would be an open pit latrine with flies flying around there. And right next to the pit latrine will be like a water ditch. So they can get their water. At the same place, they take a shit. So that would be, they'd be sleeping on the floor in the dirt. The housing quarters would be made out of mud and straw, of course. But they would have a killer sound system so they can listen to their rap music, just being America and everything. You've got to have their rap music. And let's see, the camp counselors are all pedophiles. Well, here's what I think a Nigglet summer camp would be like. Excuse me. You start early in the morning, and by early in the morning for Niggers, I mean like 1 p.m. You have a good breakfast of chitlins and thighs from Popeyes, and maybe a small glass of King Cobra, because it's early in the day. You don't want it getting all wasted. So a small glass of mud. And you have your first activity of the day, about 2 o'clock. You have a janky workshop. You have all the Nigglets take a dump into a bottle. And you stay in the bottle, seal them up, bury them out in the forest, and you start making some janky. It's like an arts and crafts sort of thing to give the Niggers some busy work. You may be about, let's say, 4 o'clock-ish, taking them out to the lake for an attempted swim, and I mean attempted because Niggas don't water, you know, don't mix. So you'd probably lose about a third of the Nigglets there from drowning. And then after a couple hours to that, about 6 o'clock, it'd be time for, well, for us humans it'd be time for dinner, for Nigglets it'd be about time for lunch. So I don't know, guess our barbecue sandwiches or whatever. Some grape drink. And then after that's done, it's about 8 o'clock, you know, maybe you can have a movie. It can be movie night. You can have them watch some classics like, you know, Boys in the Hood or How High or Friday. Yeah, Friday, next Friday, you know, maybe do a whole night of watching, you know, Friday and the sequels. Or maybe have an ice cube movie night. And then to top it off, about 10 o'clock, once it's dark, you know, do like campfire. You know, in a normal summer camp, you have a campfire. You have the kids sitting around the fire and sing some songs. So I mean, instead of singing, say, bingo, or she'll be coming around the mountain, they can sing, you know, some old Tupac Shakur classics or sing, sing Fugitive Police. Hey, don't forget Miss Peaches. Yeah, Miss Peaches or sing some Natura's B.I.G. tunes. You know, go to campfire music. And then about one in the morning, just give the kids some crack, you know, get them ready for bed. And that's a day right there. Perfect nigger summer camp. That's a good day. You got any ideas to add to the nigger summer camp experience black metal? Well, I would think that you would get more of your disadvantage youths as the liberals would call it. So you'd have to have in there some marksmanship training with AK-47s. You know, they got to make sure they got the right stance, leg spread, holding it sideways, a good old fashioned spray and pray. Hope that they can at least hit some of the bystanders. Another good one would be, I don't know if this would be arts and crafts or, well, it would be graffiti, but they would have to take some purple drink as it's called, a bottle of Robotussin, what have you. See how high they can get and see what kind of graffiti they can make on the walls of their moth huts. How about a rape class? You know, I thought it was good to see a throw in there. I don't know, nice. That's a bad idea because niggers know how to rape from birth. It kind of comes natural. So, I hate to shoot you down like that. Well, that's not true. I think he's on to something. See what they need to do is teach them how to get used to mace, the quickest way of pinning down a person and raping whatever orifice or just behind the knees or armpit, whatever they can get to as fast as they can. That's it. They need to know this kind of stuff. There's just so much stuff they can do. They can make a portrait of 50 cent out of macaroni or make a picture of a housing project out of construction paper. There's so much niggers could do at a good nigger summer camp. And the counselors, of course, would be your typical nigger drug addicts and welfare recipients and whatever at a scum you can round up and any perfect role models for the nigglets because they would teach them basically what their future would be like. Well, the campfire, actually, they wouldn't be using wood. They would be using typical nigger fare like used tires, radiator hoses, gasoline. And books because they don't need books. I think they'd fragile up some of the drowned nigglets, too. That could be some good fire right there. They just roll them around on the spit, put an apple in its mouth. Well, you might as well have a pig roast out there, you know. I mean, God, I mean, I don't know who would eat that, but still. And well, I mean, there's other activities, I guess, they could go canoeing, although I find it hard to believe niggers would want to go out in the water like that. God, what else? I guess there's sports. I can play some basketball. Yeah, he took it to the worst out of my mouth. You know, some back of ball and they can learn how to do their slam dunks and maybe, I don't know, practice some football and zone dances. Well, here's an idea. For a summer camp, if they have a summer camp for girls, you know, they got to give proper nigger parenting classes to the six, seven-year-old nigglet cells to prepare them for eventually when they become pregnant at nine. And it's really quite wide open. Well, indeed. I mean, actually, to make it fun, they can give an award to whoever gets pregnant first before the camp is over. And the winner is, the winner is Shanique, where she got pregnant in ten minutes. They should also teach them how to fill out their welfare forms properly. That is some good advanced knowledge for the nigglet. Too soon, we'll be living off the system. Of course. Well, you got to teach them the skills. And that skills is spelled with a Z, like zebra at the end. The skills they'll need to get by, in the real world, how to fill out welfare forms. You know, how to, I don't know, you know, how to get whatever they can out of the government, how to get a section A department, how to get food stamps, you know, what you can buy with food stamps, what you can't. You know, basically, how to lie about your means so you can get more welfare. You know, how much money you get per nigglet that you give birth to. Denying paternity. Of course. You know, how to sign up for the Moray show. Basic needs that young niggers need to get by in life. Yeah. So these niggers, some of them, can be a very positive thing, I think, for our African American youth. They can learn some skills that serve them well in their life as useless, worthless, scummy ass burdens on society. So, I think Obango should provide some federal funding for this stuff. Yeah, nigger summer camps. That would be perfect. I mean, humans could have their summer camps and, you know, the nigglets could have their summer camps. Maybe culturally relevant as well. Well, actually, truth be told, if it was up to me, this is what my idea of a nigger summer camp would be like. You take a big space shuttle. So, that would be a redesigned space shuttle to be able to fit at least a few thousand niggers. So, it would have to be sort of like a slave spaceship, basically. You could fit a lot of niggers in a relatively small space. Shoot them off into space at the end. That summer camp. Let the vacuum of space take care of them. Yeah, that'll be their camp. Basically, exploding and exploding in the vacuum of space. How about that? I think we forgot one thing, too."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_12", "transcript": "But into March I realized that locking down wasn't necessary. In fact, I was so naive at the time, I had no idea. I thought I would call a few people, had some connections with the medical community, pretty extensive actually in my state. And I thought I could call around and let people know, like, hey, we've got a strategy here. It's not bad. We can prophylax and we could use hydroxychloroquine as a first line therapy. We don't need to lock down. We can protect our elderly with prophylaxis, really low doses. And I actually thought that that was actually going to be well received. Instead I was told to go home and don't use the personal protective equipment because I was just wasting resources. And I literally was on the phone. I won't say who it was, but a fairly well high up person in our society in Texas on one of the boards. And I told him, I said, how old are you? He said, I'm 40 something. I said, look, I've been through the AIDS epidemic. We didn't know if we touched the patients, what was going to happen. And I go, I've been through another. That pandemic itself was very eye opening for me. I was very scared. I was a young doc. And I didn't go home. I went to work. I went to work. I'm going to see patients. I told them right then, I said, look, I don't mean to hurt your feelings, but as far as I'm concerned, you're a coward. You go home. You go home. I said, I'm not going home. I'm going to work. I go, I did six years in the ER, 100, 200 hours a month. I've been on a bunch of trauma teams. I'm not going home. I'm going to see patients. So that turned into short visits with some of my friends, some of my patients who would call me knowing that I'd talked to them about this disease. And I ended up treating the disease. And then I got on a Facebook Live video that in about two hours reached 100,000 people. And I saw it. And I was like, oh my god, I'm going to get some repercussions. Sure enough, I did. The board came calling. And they said, you said that hydroxychloricin works. And you're basically a public menace. And we want to know who you treated. You said at the time it was really early on. I said, treat three patients. And I had to provide all the records, all the information. I was very intimidated, as you might imagine, because I have to practice. I have to feed my family. I love what I'm doing. But I'm not independently wealthy. I was a little bit afraid, really was. That lasted about a day. At that point, again, as Simone, as Dr. Gold said, we've got to do the right thing for the patients. And at the time, I wrote a bunch of letters saying, I'm not going to let my patients get on vents and neck moats. It's not going to happen. I'm not going to allow it to happen. I'm going to treat them. I don't care. Well, suffice it to say, I got reprimanded. I'm still in a process of negotiation with that whole thing. But as Dr. Armstrong said, I'm really not afraid. I know I'm doing the right thing. I've treated a number of patients. I won't tell you how many, because then I'll probably have to provide records for all that. So for the purposes of this statement, I'm going to say I treated three. OK. So the fear of reprisal is the reason why we're in this place right now. Docs don't want to do this. There's a fear of reprisal. I was very worried about it. And I can tell you all the people who believe in this medication, who believe in early treatment, feel the same way. They're really scared to go forward and treat patients because they don't want to lose their medical license. And that's a big deal. So the intimidation is a big deal. Mr. Jordan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Doc Fauci, do protests increase the spread of the virus? Do protests increase the spread of the virus? I think I can make a general statement. Well, half a million protesters on June 6th alone. I'm just asking, that number of people does it increase the spread of the virus? Crowding together, particularly when you're not wearing a mask, contributes to the spread of the virus. Should we limit the protesting? I'm not sure what you mean. How do we say limit the protesting? Should the government limit the protesting? I don't think that's relevant to... Well, you just said if it increases the spread of the virus, I'm just asking, should we limit it? Well, I'm not in a position to determine what the government can do in a forceful way. Well, you make all kinds of recommendations. You make comments on dating, on baseball, and everything you can imagine. I'm just asking, you just said, protests increase the spread. I'm just asking, should we try to limit the protest? No, I think I would leave that to people who have more of a position to do that. I can tell you. The government's stopping people from going to church, Dr. Fauci. Last week in the Calvary Chapel case, five liberals on the Supreme Court said it was okay for Nevada to limit church services. I mean, Justice Gorsuch said it best. He said, there's no world in which the Constitution permits Nevada to favor Caesar's palace over Calvary Chapel. I'm just asking, is there a world where the Constitution says you can favor one First Amendment Liberty protesting over another, practicing your faith? I'm not favoring anybody over anybody. I'm just making a statement that's a broad statement that avoid crowds of any type no matter where you are, because that leads to the acquisition and transmission. And I don't judge one crowd versus another crowd. When you're in a crowd, particularly if you're not wearing a mask, that induces the spread. It's a simple question, Dr. Should we limit the protest? Government is obviously limiting people going to church. And look, there's been no violence that I can see at church. I haven't seen people during a church service go out and harm police officers or burn buildings. But we know that, I mean, for 63 days, nine weeks it's been happening in Portland. One night in Chicago, 49 officers were injured. But no limit to protest, but boy, you can't go to church on Sunday. What was this? I don't know how many times I can answer that. I'm not gonna repine on limiting anything. I'm just gonna tell you. You've repined on a lot of things, Dr. Fauci. Yeah, but I've never said. I mean, something that directly impacts the spread of the virus. And I'm asking your position on the protest. Yeah, well, I'm not gonna repine on limiting anything. I'm telling you what it is, the danger. And you can make your own conclusion about that. You should stay away from crowds, no matter where the crowds are. Government has stopped people from going to work. In fact, just in New Jersey four days ago, Ian Smith, Frank Trumbetta were arrested for opening up, trying to operate their business, their gym. They were arrested. But my bet is if these two individuals who owned this gym were outside just in front of their gym and all the people who were working out in their gym were outside protesting, they'd been just fine. But because they were in the gym working out actually running their business, they got arrested. You think that's okay? You know, I'm not gonna repine on who gets arrested and who does not. I mean, you get where I'm going. I'm telling you, as a public health official, do you see the inconsistency though, Dr. Fauci? There's no inconsistency, Congressman. What, there's no inconsistency. So you're allowed to protest millions of people on one day in crowds yelling, screaming, but you try to run your business, you get arrested. And if you stood right outside of that same business and protested, you wouldn't get arrested, you don't see an inconsistency there? I don't understand what you're asking me as a public health official to opine on who should get arrested or not. That's not my position. You could ask me as much as you want. No, you've advocated for a certain business. You've advocated for certain businesses to be shut down. I'm just asking you on your position on the protest. I mean, I haven't seen one, we've heard a lot about hair salons. I haven't seen one hairstylist who between haircuts goes out and attacks police or set something on fire. But we've seen all kinds of that stuff during protests and we know the protests actually increased the spread of the virus. You've said that. I said crowds. I didn't say specifically. I didn't say protest to anything. So the protests don't increase the spread of the virus? I didn't say that you're putting words in my mouth. No, I just want an answer to the question. Do the protests increase the spread of the virus? I don't have any scientific evidence that anything. I can tell you that crowds are known, particularly when you don't have a mask, to increase the acquisition and transmission. No matter what the crowd is. So you don't have a position on whether the protest increased the spread of the virus or don't increase the spread of the virus? I'm saying that crowds, wherever the crowds are, can give you an increased probability that there's gonna be acquisition and transmission. But do you understand Americans' concern? Protesting, particularly according to the Democrats, is just fine, but you can't go to work, you can't go to school, you can't go to church. There's limits placed on all three of those fundamental activities, first amendment activities, but protesting is just fine. The gentleman's time has expired, but I will just ask the gentleman to just think about his question and put it in reference to crowds that yell at political meetings at fundraisers without masks on an all rig in Texas. Nobody wearing a mask, nobody's social distancing, but a fundraiser. Would that be problematic? With that, I'll yield five minutes to Mr. Foster."}

Seven News has learnt the headmaster there is now under fire for using a racist slur at a school assembly. Words are a matter of principle for this Brighton College educator. We're looking for not just what has been communicated, but how it's been communicated. But his words have landed him in hot water using a racist slur not once, but three times at school assembly. Mission Brown Papers are actually called a m*** brown paper. Ooh! Oh, yeah, it was. Richard Minnack used the N-word in the wake of the Christchurch terror attack to highlight insidious racism. So Mission Brown Papers are only a tiny step in language away from the m*** brown paper. Oh, no, I'm not saying. 1,400 students were there, including the boy who egged Senator Fraser Anning. Many gasped in shock. You can't say that in front of a school, especially a school as multicultural as ours. Mr Minnack later emailed students to apologise and explain. I hope you understand that I used it to call out and criticise racism and bigotry. Sometimes we have to use offensive words to explain why they are offensive. But now the slur is being used in the playground. I think their theory behind it is if the principal can say why can't we? Late today, the Education Department told 7 News principal Minnack should not have used what they called the offensive word. A spokesperson says he will now be reminded by the department to use appropriate language. Mike."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_48", "transcript": "Hi folks, my perspective here. In this clip I want to analyse a bit of TV programming that was broadcast in the clip. They had a laser beam and a boat. As the boat went further away from the laser beam over a body of water, the projected mark went higher and higher as the boat went away. This was an indication that the water was curved and so therefore we live on a ball and not a flat earth. So listen carefully, this is part of the program where they tell you about what they're doing and we're going to analyse this. Just three miles away the laser seems to have risen by six feet but we know the beam is level so that suggests that the lake is now six feet lower. To see a six foot drop when everything looked flat to me was kind of mind boggling. It kind of shattered my perspective in about one second and made me rethink what was going on. Guys, if the laser is three metres on the boat and the laser is a straight line it has to be three metres off the ground. Because it's a straight line. That's what they're claiming. If it's a straight line the laser also has to be three metres off the ground if there's a bulge in the middle. Because that's what they're saying. If the laser is below that means the boat has to be bigger. The boat would have to increase in its size for the laser to project onto the boat. You see you can't have a lopsided bulge between the boat and the laser. In fact these people, the whole show is fake. The whole thing is a lot of rubbish. If you move the boat and the laser, if you move the laser 20 degrees to your right, the boat is the same distance from the laser you'll get a different reading. You can't have a bulge of water between yourself and the boat because at this angle you'll have a different reading. So even if they say to you, well no you just move the bulge forward now, see problem solved. Well you know, I know that the bulge can't follow the laser and the bulge can't follow the boat. But this stuff is fake. It's not a real science. It's propaganda. But we know the blemish level. But we know the blemish level. But we know the blemish level. But we know the blemish level. But we know the blemish level. We'll go on a helicopter. Sounds like a plan. So now these globalist propagandists, what they're doing is they swap the boat for a helicopter and the laser for a telescope. And they're telling the helicopter to fly out further. And now they're going to make the helicopter drop below the curve of the water. Now think about this. How ridiculous this is. This is supposed to be a science lesson to prove that the water is curved. Think about how stupid this is. This is so insane. It's a joke. So the helicopter drops below the line of sight. How can the trees still be above the helicopter? And the mountains still be in the same place. Because it's simple. The helicopter needs to fly from right to left. And you would see it go below the bulge. And then you'd see it reappear on the left side of the bulge. Don't understand. Or otherwise the bulge of water in front of them is a tube. Don't understand how stupid this whole thing is. This whole experiment is just propaganda. It's fake. It's nonsense. Perception is still it's a flat lake. But it's not a flat lake. It's not a flat lake. That was crazy. I was definitely blown away by the fact that the laser was that high off the water. Look this is a deer. These animals, when the lake freezes over, they can get stuck. Once they lose their footing, they try to get up and then eventually they lose strength. They become weak. And unfortunately if they don't rescue them in time, they have to put the animal down. So the issue is, if there's a bulge of water, if the water is bent, this animal would never be able to get stuck in the middle of the lake. Because it would just slide down. Because remember in the experiment, the two shores are on the same line. And now do you understand how ridiculous their claim is? You see wolves walk across the lake. When the lake is frozen, people ice skate on the lake. Think about it. Could this lady skate on a ball, an ice ball that is spinning at 1,600 km an hour and hurtling through space at 110,000 km an hour? And these people just willingly just skate calmly on a bulge of frozen water. Just think. Or is it propaganda? What do your eyes see? What does your mind tell you? And what are they telling you? They're telling you the truth? Or is it propaganda? You need to think about these things. You see, is the media being controlled? If the media is being controlled, you need to think about what you watch. If you're watching violent programs, if you're playing violent TV games, it's going to make you violent. If you watch stupid, it's going to make you stupid. Don't watch TV blindly and blankly with a blank mind because you're allowing them to program you. So, R-E-M, the band R-E-M rapid eye movement, only happens when you're forced to sleep. So, what are they telling you? They're showing that for a campus to work, the earth has to be flat. Everybody's on the same plane. They're also pointing out something in a bad direction. Where's north? It's not in the middle. You need to think about that. So, at least they had the courage and the strength to go against the flow and say, something's wrong. You see, we're not being told the truth. The people who control the system, the truth and what is right and justice isn't on the agenda. Manipulation and deceit is what they do. So I hope this makes you think and cheers and thanks for watching."}

I'm from Pittsburgh and on Monday I lost my job, ending the first period of financial stability I've ever had in my life. When I joined DSA, I had less than $5 to my name and I was homeless. I joined DSA after a comrade who's actually here today, thank you, Crystal, paid my dues for me. I was between jobs and had just dropped out of college for the second time. I was lost, scared, and suicidal. DSA meetings became my rock. Pittsburgh is deeply committed to snacks at meetings, which I am deeply thankful for, as those were among the rare meals I was able to count on. CB23 also removes the only gendered language in our constitution and would make sure that the DSA constitution is inclusive of gender non-conforming and non-binary comrades. As a co-author of CB23, I've been asked, why don't we just make dues arbitrarily small, something like $5, a cup of coffee? Please hear me when I say that when you have 86 cents to your name and no groceries to eat, $5 is insurmountable. I have also been asked if this would create a system of paper members who join but don't contribute. Please hear me when I say that a socialist organization should value its members because of how much they're able to contribute, we should not value because of how much they're able to contribute, we should value them because our lives are inherently important. Please hear me when I say that nobody is too poor for DSA and please vote yes on CB23."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_57", "transcript": "I think it's primarily a misinterpretation, an intentional misinterpretation of Dr. King. His non-violence was strategic. It wasn't that violence wasn't necessary, it was that we couldn't win with violence. We couldn't get our agenda accomplished with violence. America is showing us something totally different right now. It is saying we will not pay you any attention until you burn something down. And that's not our fault. If it was up to me, Glenn, if it was up to me, I would be somewhere writing a book right now. We're zipping a mimosa, doing all the cosmopolitan things that we have all been accustomed to and programmed to desire and want. But America is signaling to us that we will not give you any attention. We will not pay any attention to your grievances unless you are burning something down. So the strategy inherently has to change. And then even still, I want to correct myself a little more, it wasn't until they saw the violence of Bloody Sunday that well-meaning liberals were actually kicked into gear to say, okay, we have to do something. So it really is a condemnation of the United States of America that in order for us to have any type of meaningful change, violence has to be attached to it. And maybe that's the curse of America being such a violent nation."}
{"vid": "non_hate_video_58", "transcript": "Now, how do I know that the white people know that we are going to come up with a solution to the problem? I know it because they have retina scans, they have what they call racial profiling, DNA banks, and they're monitoring our people to try to prevent the one person from coming up with the one idea. And the one idea is how we are going to exterminate white people because that, in my estimation, is the only conclusion I have come to. We have to exterminate white people off of the face of the planet to solve this problem. Now, I don't care whether you clap or not, but I'm saying to you that we need to solve this problem because they are going to kill us. And I will leave on that. So we have to just set up our own system and stop playing and get very serious and not be diverted from coming up with a solution to the problem. And the problem on the planet is white people.

{"vid": "non_hate_video_59", "transcript": "Someone's stalking us. Hey buddy, why you following us? Ow! Ow! Did you just stab him? Whoa, he just stabbed him dude! In this video, we get to watch some Antifa beat up an Antifa before dragging his ass down to the police who arrest him for stabbing Black Rebel. That last part's not funny, but it is funny watching Antifa beat up other Antifa and getting them arrested. In the middle of a riot that's all about, you know, we hate the police, that's what it's all about, right? The police are racist, we're having a riot against the police. They dragged one of their own to the police after beating him up. This is so great. But the stabbing part is not. Anyway. Yeah, feel free to use whatever you need, Justin, on my page. You don't even have to ask. I won't come after you later for it. Again, like I said, you do good work. I appreciate it. Well, alright, thanks, cool. And likewise to you too, I appreciate what you do for America as does my wife, right Tabby? Hell yeah. He's out there driving around America doing his thing and just, you know, basically he's, he's kind of like a cheerleader for America. I mean, it's challenging everybody's narrative too, even my own. I don't quite understand. But I respect the guy, that's for sure. So if you folks don't already know, Drew aka Black Rebel was stabbed in Portland at night, 55, 56 or so of rioting, straight rioting, apparently by an antipypetophile. And wow, we're hearing more and more and more antipypetophiles these days. I don't know what's going on there. Anyway. Are they actually showing their concolors then? Yeah, maybe they're feeling bold enough to just be open about it. I'm not sure. But for more details on what happened here at the stabbing, see the link below for part one and also see the links below to Drew's channel, Black Rebel. And maybe at some point there will be a link to a GoFundMe or some other fundraiser for Drew, if you may need it for hospital bills and or to pay a bill for this rental car. We'll get into that later. But here we go with part two. Let us have a look at Drew's Twitter. I have not looked at this yet. I want to make something clear. Um, go ahead. Is there a weapon in there? Is he got a gun in there? Is he fucking playing with his dick in there? I don't know. He's doing something. He's following us. That's going to get even me a fucking problem. Yeah, especially because we know. And Drew may be a little physically aggressive with the slap on the fucking shoulder as he hugged him. But that's what you do when somebody is fucking stalking you. You make damn sure everybody in public knows you're talking to this piece of shit. That's what Drew did. Yeah. This man, this, I'm sorry, I'm not going to call him a man. This fucking pervert, this Antifa pervert, stalked them, hunted him and waited for the most opportune moment to try and murder him. That's what happened. Antifa are a bunch of opportunistic fucking cowards and murderers. And they also like sticking their body parts in children. And Drew's timeline at 9.59 p.m. on the 24th, Haley Adams, you folks may remember Haley Adams from Portland's Liberation, tweeted, Stop targeting black and Latino people, you racist piece of shit. And by the way, Haley is supposed to be a white Nazi, even though she's at least part Jewish, I think. But here we have a white Jewish Nazi concern with black people and Latino people. Wow. Anyway, stop targeting black and Latino people, you racist piece of shit. We all know how you guys love through salt and beat on people of color in Portland. She's absolutely right. Didn't I just say that a short while ago? At Space Force USA, that's Drew. And at Deplorable Low, that's Jen Low, life matters. In other words, she's saying this black man and this brown woman's life matters. Put an end to terrorism and racism. Leave my friends alone, communist scums. And then she linked to the tweet that has since been protected by Twitter. Because they like to protect these kind of people. We see you, Twitter. We see you. We see you, Jack. You're not Twitter. You're child rapist syndicate. That's what it is. Because Twitter loves their pedophiles. Oh yeah, they do. They just, oh God, we've got all the pedophiles on the plant right here. Twitter. Oh, and TikTok. TikTok is number two on who has the most pedophile. Yeah, but Twitter is, Twitter considers child rape to be a sexual orientation. Yes, they're lumping in gay people and bisexual people with child rapists. And we're the people who are wrong. We're the ones that apparently don't sympathize with the gay or trans community. And I do. And I don't think that you lumping them in with fucking child rapists is a fair thing to do. Because I have gay friends. They don't rape children. I have trans friends. They don't rape children. You know why? Because they're decent human beings. They're just a little different. Yeah. You assholes are perverts. Rape is not a sexual orientation. It is not. It's perverted, disgusting, and I don't care how you swing it. You should fucking be chopped into pieces and put a fox and sunk to the bottom of the ocean. Dirt bags. Yeah. Now, what else? I feel like there was something else I wanted to go over. Okay, we got to go back to this. But that was on the 24th. And the stabbing, by the way, happened on the 24th. So they threatened these people, threatened to do it, and then they did it. And I challenge any of you people out there to find any examples of Antifa denouncing this. I'll wait. So it was at 3.35 a.m. last night, the 25th, that Drew tweeted this, all of you guys who attacked the Seattle preacher, wow, this is scary foreshadowing. This is scary. Before he got stabbed, he was talking about all of you guys who attacked the Seattle preacher, and folks hopefully you know about that. And by the way, there was a black man killed in another city, a black Trump supporter killed in another city in Milwaukee. Thank you, Tabby. And I have not even had time to look into that other than just hearing about it. I'll give you a small thing. He's a black pro-Trump supporter. He's very vocal about it. He stands on the same corner with his signs pasted all over a building. And I think it was yesterday, or was it today? It was yesterday. He got in a scuffle over some asshole trying to steal his signs, some anti-Trump delusional fuck wit, most likely a BLM, trying to steal his signs. And he fought back and they shot him. And he died. Yeah. He died for what he stood for. And you know what? Brave man. Brave man. And I hope whoever fucking killed him dies in the most horrendous way humanly possible. And if I get, if I'm lucky, and I worked the odds of the fucking lotto, that's some of a bitch will drop into my hands. That's what I want. That's what I want. That's not okay. It's not okay. But anyway, Black Rebel tweeted this, all of you guys who attacked the Seattle preacher, that mace was brought to you by the courtesy of the Black Rebel. And then we have people saying, oh yeah, well then you deserve to be stabbed. Okay. Yeah. 11 hours ago from when I'm recording this, 6.02am, he tweeted I got stabbed in Portland and I on my way to the hospital. And we have an Instagram link and it's basically just the same thing. Okay. So I don't need that. All right. Now let's have a look at this tweet by Drew from 821am on the 25th. All right. You guys, I got stabbed. I'm on my way to the hospital. Are you stabbed, honey? I don't know what it is. Why are you stream on Twitter? Make sure y'all share this. Yes. I don't know how bad it is. Okay. I just want to get off of here in the morning. But I'm on the way to the hospital. Some of the people do that was falling on the phone. So I'm hoping to ask them what happened and he stabbed me. So I'll keep you guys updated. So there you go folks. This is what things are coming down to. Let's look at what else he's got here. This is probably from the undisclosed hospital bed. Twitter is to blame for a lot of the senseless attacks against conservative journalists. They remove alt-right groups but refuse to recognize the doxing by alt-left or domestic terrorist groups like Antifa who openly encourage this type of violence every day. And it's not just alt-right. It's everybody who's not far left that they find. If they find them, oh, there is one. It's like from Pink Floyd's The Wall. There is one up and then get him up against the wall. There is one in the spotlight. He doesn't think right. Get him up against the wall. That one is black and he refrains the toe of the line. Make an example of them all. And there are women of color not following and not fitting in our box. Get her up against the wall if I had. And there, that one's a Jew. They have a tactu. That one's got spots. If I've had my way, I'd have all of them shot. And I'm sure they would. What have we here? Drew is retweeting Anteanose tweet where he says, if the dog beats a man in the middle of downtown Portland, they say he stabbed someone. Oh, okay. Let's look at this then. Come on. The funny thing is, some of these people who are gang-stopping this guy, they're going to find out that they were beating up a fellow Antifa. And that he's a pedo. And that he stabbed the black guy. And they're going to be so confused. Wait, did I do a good thing by beating him up or not? I can't tell. Did I just beat up a freedom fighter who fights against black Nazis? Or did I beat up a white Nazi who claims to be fighting against black Nazis or not? I mean, he's a pedo. Did I do a good thing? Do I do a bad thing? Did I attack one of my own or are they not one of my own? Yeah. That's how morally bankrupt these people are. Moving on, let's see what else we got here. And another tweet by Andy Noe, retweeted by black rebel with the message, I'm glad people stepped in to drag my attacker to the police. He's currently sitting on a $250,000 bail for felony assault. Is this the same video? More chaos in those days? No, different video. So Andy Noe's tweet is more chaos in the streets of downtown Portland at the riot. Some person is dragged away. Bitch! Yeah, take him to the car. There you go. Now what else we have here? Black rebel 48 minutes ago as of my time. So that's around 6 p.m. Eastern or 3 p.m. Pacific. I'm in Portland because it's a free country and he's responding to this here. Let's see what this is. This is a tweet by mosaic2g2. I'm sorry, I don't know who that is. Richard Blake Hampey was arrested on $250,000 bond. You wrote $250 bond. Why was the quote black rebel unquote in Portland? That's the shit that wait, I'm hearing in 5, 4, 3, 2, QAnon. Fox News Axios will probably have him on instead of the man whose head was split with a rubber bullet. Okay, well, you know, it's not entirely coherent with this guy's trying to say. They're not always that literate, but I think we get the idea. Basically, he deserved it because he was there. He was a black man who dared to disagree with them in their town. How fucking tolerant of you fucking bigots. And that person was responding to this by block, block button on limited who tweeted hearing a black man was stabbed by a character clad in all black. Well, he wasn't who was chased to 711, but the police came and the man couldn't quite escape. Can anyone verify this? Feel free to DM me. Maybe they're talking about a different incident. I'm not sure, but this guy is apparently talking about Richard. So yeah, he deserved it is what this person is saying. But black rebels response drew his response to the question of what were you doing in Portland is I am in Portland because it's a free country. You people don't understand this is fucking America. You don't get to own a town and say get the fuck out of our town that we've heard Antica say for years now. Get out of our town, get out of Portland, get out of Berkeley, get out of this. It's not yours. It's not fucking yours. Okay. Oh, and then at the same time they have the gall to be like open borders, open borders, get the fuck out of our town, get the fuck out of our town. I mean, we've even put videos out showing them saying get the fuck out. You do not have that right. You can leave if you don't like it. You have that choice. You don't have to, but you can, but you don't get the force anybody out or keep anybody out. Go fuck yourself. All right, folks, I want to wrap this up. Sorry that this has gone on so long and sorry that I'm putting this out so late. I am working with subpar equipment, subpar connection, everything's slow. My connection's slow. My computer's slow. My microphone and your head doesn't work half the time, blah, blah, blah, blah. Oh, oh, it's me. Who cares? Who cares? But listen, Drew is probably going to need financial help. Okay. But we have more to come out about this from Drew himself and et cetera. Be careful out there. Tonight in Portland, it's probably going to be a lot worse. In fact, I will be surprised if nobody dies tonight. All right, folks, stay safe out there. Make sure that you squash the street Nazis. Make sure you subscribe. There was some bichutes so you can hear what we really think about all this that we can't tell you on YouTube. Thanks very much for watching everyone. And Drew man, heal fast. So all I got to say and Jen low, stay safe. All right, folks. Thanks for watching."}

{"vid": "non_hate_video_67", "transcript": "Today we're going to be looking at one of the justifications given from Muhammad's marriage to 6 year old Aisha. Let's go ahead and watch the video. Now let us look at the fruit that came from the tree so we can understand it. Who was Aisha Radhiva Anha? She is the woman that memorized the Quran. When the Quran was revealed, when the last ayats of the Quran, the last 6,636 ayats were revealed. Three months later Aisha had memorized the whole Quran. Think about that. Secondly, let's look at Aisha Radhiva Anha. Aisha Radhiva Anha because she lived with the Prophet ﷺ. She saw him, she understood him intimately, clearly. Her mind was bright and she was a powerful young girl. A very aggressive young girl. Powerful, aggressive and deep and intelligent. Memorized the whole Quran and guess what? She was holding with her when the Prophet ﷺ passed away at least 2,600 Ahadith that nobody else knew. That's why after Abu Hurairah, nobody related to us more hadith than Aisha Radhiva Anha. So the justification given for Muhammad's marriage to a child is that Aisha was able to memorize the Quran within a matter of months and also that because she knew the Prophet so intimately, she was able to provide many of the hadith that are now used to assist Muslims in determining how to live their lives in a way that is pleasing to Allah. However, is this sufficient justification for Muhammad marrying a child and making child marriage a part of the Islamic religion? Was there no other way that the Quran could be recorded or the hadith collected? And of course, the obvious answer is no. There are many different ways that the Quran could have been recorded and preserved that did not involve child marriage. For example, Allah could have simply invented a pen given one of his followers some paper and taught them how to read and write. In my opinion, that would have been a much more moral way to preserve the Quran. But let me know what you think in the comment section. If you like this video, hit the like button, subscribe, hit the notification button and I'll see you in the next video where I'll be giving a slightly more serious and in-depth analysis of another of the justifications of child marriage in the Islamic religion."}

Now police sources are telling many networks that Mr. Smollett is under a potential investigation for, you know, concocting a story and paying these men. Is it time to revisit what you said about these remarks? What is your feeling on potential hopes, hate crimes in general? Well, the information's still coming out and I'm going to withhold until all the information actually comes out from on the record sources. We know in America that bigoted and biased attacks are on the rise in a serious way. We actually even know in this country that since 9-11 the majority of the terrorist attacks on our soil have been right-wing terrorist attacks. The majority of them white supremacist attacks from the horrific shootings in Pittsburgh or in South Carolina church. What we're seeing is attacks on people because they're different and we all need to join together and condemn those attacks and the hatred and the bigotry that sources them. But would you think it's time for Mr. Smollett to address this more publicly though given what's happened? Again, I'm following this in the news as you are and we'll see what happens. But what in the risk of, you know, a hoax of attack, wouldn't that be a detriment to the work that you're trying to do with your anti-lynching bill? Wouldn't that hurt the movements somehow? We have seen painful realities surge in our country, rise in anti-Semitism, anti-Islamic attacks. We're seeing just vicious, horrific, cruel violence that's motivated by bias and hate.

{"vid": "non_hate_video_85", "transcript": "Okay, sorry. A few seconds to things I can do. Anyway, this is about Stefan Malinu getting booted from MailChimp and a couple things. And I couldn't find anything else but these really opinionated rags. The Daily Dot and the other one is called News Hub, which is out of New Zealand. Alright, the Daily Dot goes, so I'm not going to read all, I'm just going to read some stuff that's in here. But pretty much he was booted from MailChimp because my God, he has opinions people don't like. And I'll go through here and it goes, hey, at MailChimp, at MailChimp abuse, did you know you power white nationalists except for Malinu's email newsletter? Malinu promotes eugenics, race science, and men's rights activism. Okay, first off, I've listened and seen a lot of his stuff. Not everything, some stuff I'm like, whatever. I don't do his calling show, I think some of the stuff is kind of boring and preachy and I don't agree with everything he says. But he does not promote eugenics. Race science, he has talked about racial differences based on, what is it doing now? That's not what I would. Okay. Oh, this is her getting ratioed. Black guy calling her cowards, Maribor saying I would delete mail. I actually did this by accident. Sixth Exon Hammer, Sixth Exon says, talk about virtue signaling. No research either, just ban. Now, I want to tell you this in my personal opinion, I mean, there's just a lot more. Geez, time to leave MailChimp before they terminate your accounts because US sanctions or something. This guy goes, person goes, well, thank you for taking yourselves out of the running for me and deciding which service I use. I'm not going to volunteer you, sir. That will cancel me to make Twitter happy. And it goes on and on and on. But I'm going to go through this, I don't know, whatever. But, I mean, if you talk about it, I mean, he's talked about it, he's talked about with it from different journals and books that have been written. But he doesn't really go into it. He does talk about certain things and I'm not going to get into it. I'm not here to talk about that. I'm not here to talk about the rights. Oh, my God. Men and women are different. Men and women have different needs and different rights issues. Just like men and women, they have different medical needs. Men get prostate cancer. Women don't because they don't have prostates. Men can get testicular cancer. Women don't get testicular cancer because they don't have testiculars. Yeah, I'm kind of doing this Jeff Fox with the thing. Just like men and women can both get breast cancer, though it mainly affects women. Women can get cancer in the uterus. I think the uterine cancer, that's the one that kind of happens. Everybody in the world, they can't say that one, it's just kind of driving us today. And guys can't get that. They can't get cancer in the uterus because they don't have a uterus. Women have certain medical issues they have to deal with and men have certain medical issues we have to deal with because we're different. Which is an obvious thing. There are certain issues where women have certain rights issues where they're being screwed over because there are women in certain cases and that needs to be addressed. And if men are getting screwed over in certain cases because there are women, that needs to be addressed too. People's rights need to be addressed with their men or women. The fact that he's going to focus more on, we have tons of groups over focusing on women stuff. I'm focusing on women like it's crazy. But the minute you want to focus on how men are getting fucked over, and I do mean fucked over, people throw a fit. And this is great. But the fact that she did this in date, it's more like this was planned. She knew someone. I guarantee you this person knew someone at MailChimp. And this was, I'm telling you, I'm going to guess. My guess is, I think, I don't know for sure. This is my conclusion. This is my guess. I don't know why I came up with the conclusion, but this is what my guess is. She knew someone at MailChimp. And this was a planned thing. This didn't come out of nowhere. Trust me. Because there was someone, she knew at MailChimp, knew that Mike Stephan Mollin knew, but she just had to do something to get the ball rolling. Trust me. And then when they go that, they go, thank you for this. This rules, think, notice that they're using everything about how people like this rules. Like, let me tell you something. If you don't defend the people you disagree with, because there are people out there who disagree, but I agree with their right to say it. Because even people I disagree with, they're once when they come up to you, they're just like, huh, didn't think about that one. But these people are horrible people. And then he goes on to stay later on that if he had to go do the Hugo Struggle fight, he would. Because there's a lot of people that don't like him. If he got hired by a company, that company, they found out they were from that company to get ratioed until they had to fire him. And he is in Canada. It says online provocateur, Steph Amologio is being a real cute over-complaining. He won't be able to find regular appointment after saying provocative things online. Well, it's true because they would look him up and the first thing you look up under Google search is how bad Steph Amologio is. What type of jerk Steph Amologio is. You know, it's pretty much they've stacked the deck against him. Professor Scott Steiner, what am I supposed to do when people Google me, found out about me being a... You know what, first off, if that guy worked for me, he wouldn't have a job for much longer. And then, say this is everything from people who don't... People go... Because what he's trying to say is when you do Google search and the Google algorithm is set up to screw you over, and like it'll take everything people said, you say, but they won't take it completely out of context. And he's got a point that he can't... He's unemployable. But the thing though is, it's like, these are the texts. The good thing is, I live in Texas. And in Texas, let's say I started working for... There's actually some companies I call the ABC, whatever. Let's say I started working for... Let's say I started doing IT work for... I have an IT area. So I started doing IT work for Cisco. I've actually had calls from people that go work at Cisco. I've actually interviewed for Oracle before. But I've actually worked for... I've actually worked for VMware before. I love working for VMware. Great company. Let's say that I got hired for Cisco. And I'm working at Cisco. I'm just there fixing computers. And someone sees some of my stuff online and says, hey, did you know he's a white... He's this, that, and the other. Look what he said. And I get fired and I get put like, oh, because of this. Well, in Texas, I can actually sue that person for tortuous interference of a contract. And in Texas, I can sue that person for contacting Cisco or people for contacting Cisco and getting me released and get money for it and end up to cover my expenses. And then they'll get friggin' slammed. And if they make it so bad that I can't get a job and they poison the wealth for me, I can get tortuous interference of prospective contracts. And in that way, that they have to pay me for what money I might been able to make. I don't know if Canada has such laws. But in Texas, since I'm in Texas, I always say I'm in Texas because of this. In Texas, if they would have done this, if he was in Texas, they would have done this. He, and also, this is also defamation. And the reason why I say defamation, if you come here, this is where it's defamation. They say he supports, promotes eugenics. And this is how he can get them, at least in Texas, for defamation. I'm assuming I'm not a lawyer, don't play on TV, my dad was a lawyer, but nearly. This is just conjecture. This is just guessing a real lawyer could answer this. But I think this would also be a case for defamation. And the reason is, she accused you of doing eugenics. Race science, and then said men rights, doing activision for the rights of men is a bad thing. Therefore, she basically decided he promotes eugenics, by the way, which he doesn't. I'm pretty, which I'm 99% sure he does it. The reason why I never say 100% because there's always that one time, like, oh, I didn't know you supported that. I would never guessed. But he doesn't, he does not. Heck, I don't even support eugenics. Eugenics is a horrible thing. Eugenics, by the way, came from the Democrat Party. There's mainly Democrats who did that crap, not Republicans, and here in the United States. But calling, saying that he supports eugenics, and eugenics, in my opinion, is a horrible thing, is that is defamation. And this non-dini jami, however you say her name, if I did say her name wrong, I'll apologize. I will only apologize for saying people's names wrong because sometimes I'm just trying to guess. Well, this young lady here could get the living crap suit out of her. Okay? And the fact that she's admitting to it, it's like, look, this is what the Vic Mignon case. Now, I know the judge kicked a lot of stuff out, but it's being appealed. Now, I'm telling you on appeal, a lot of stuff's going to come back, and he's pretty much going to, I think he's going to end up winning this case. And in my opinion, you never know. But he's pretty much going to win a lot of the case. So, but yeah, that's about it. If I was Stefan, and if this woman is in Canada, in the United States, there might be not much he can do. But if he was in Canada, he might be able to sue, let's say she's in Canada, if he's in Canada, being a Canadian. Now, I don't know Canadian law. I don't know how it works. But he could sue her for defamation. Basically, we're claiming that because she got him. Now, now I know in the United States for what he did, what she did. This causes you cause damages to this person. All right. And this is where the laws need to be loosened. So it's easier to sue people for doing crap like this. You know, maybe if some of these people were to pay like $100,000 or get a million dollar judgment against them for pulling stunts like this, this would stop. Yeah, not the legal courts were putting her in jail for this, but make her pay the victim a million dollars. Because guess what? What if he comes in discovery and find out that she was working colluding with someone in MailChimp to do this? Well, guess what? If she comes in and sue, she might be able to sue MailChimp. He might be able to sue MailChimp. Maybe not MailChimp, but the person in MailChimp. If I own MailChimp, I would be what the F are you doing? Get the heck out. Like I said, we don't know what's behind us, but like I said earlier, and I don't want to repeat what I said earlier. I'm going to kind of wrap it up now. A, this lady did a tweet. Got Stefan Mollin, removed from MailChimp. I think that she knew someone in MailChimp, but this was a planned action in my opinion. This is my personal opinion. Two, he has, and I believe he has a right to case to sue for defamation and for damages because she defamed him. All right. The problem is why I can't say white nationalist because he might be able to get him for white nationalist because she's saying he's a racist too. And all this stuff saying that he's a racist and please do be genious. He can sue her for defamation and maybe get damages, but depending on what Canadian law says, and she's in the United States. I don't know because you're crossing national borders and this is where it becomes complicated. So, and not to mention because of the damage the left is doing to him because they don't like his views. It's going to be hard for him to find other employment because he makes his money basic as a businessman online. And hey, I don't know how he, he could be doing fine financially for all I know. He could be doing great. I don't know. I don't know how he's doing financially. So, but that's about it. Have any comments below and also that's, and tell me what you think. Right.

Police started using some of those crowd dispersal tactics like tear gas, even playing very loud sounds to push them out.

I'm a poor person, I'm a poor member of DSA. Our chapter is a majority poor chapter. I make no money, but I give everything to DSA. I give 100,000% of my labor to DSA. Members who are poor give 100% of their labor to DSA. We love this organization. This constitution by-laws change would simply redefine how we approach members. We would no longer refer to members as dues-paying members. Some of us can't afford that, but we still give our all to DSA. It would also redefine as a member in good standing, because no matter what we pay or if we can pay, we're still members in good standing. I think maybe some of you have heard me extoll the virtue of poor people's movements. If you read chapter 5, there's an entire story about the National Welfare Rights Organization and the problems that were caused by their dues system. They didn't require dues, some chapters did. It eventually fell apart. I'd like to read just one small paragraph from that. In organizing doctrine, membership means something more than merely formal affiliation through the payment of dues. It also means active participation in the life of the organization. In demonstrations, for example, mass participation is ostensibly the functional equivalent of political resources such as wealth, which interest groups elsewhere in the social structure possess. As organizers sometimes put it, poor people have numbers. Membership, in short, means regular participation by masses of people. Please support this Constitution by-laws change."}

Well, then I don't want anybody like that in the White House. So can I have my car back? And he's still there. I don't know. He signed it. We could go ask. I never knew that. Well, so the whole point of it is though, he's a human being, right? Just like you and me, and shouldn't really matter. That's what... Well, he better read the Bible. He does, and he says that God doesn't choose a political party. Why does it say in the Bible that a man shouldn't marry a woman then? Well, I totally respect your viewpoint on this. I so totally do. But I think that we were not around when I was married. How come this has never been brought out before? It's common knowledge. I never heard it. We can talk to someone if you need to talk to them about this. I don't know the rules on this or not, but I guess what I would like you to just dig deep inside and think, like, should it matter if it's a woman, or if it's a man, or if they're heterosexual or homosexual? If you believe in what they say. That's my question. It all just went right down the toilet. Is where it all just went. And that's... you are... you have a total right to your opinion. I'm not trying to tell you to think otherwise, but we'll ask what they want us to do. But I just ask you to look inside your heart, because you sound like a Christian woman to me, and I'm a Christian woman, and my God wants me to love everybody. I hope so. So you must not believe it then, if you think it's okay for somebody to marry to the same sex person. I think we're just interpreting it different, and that's okay, because everybody gets to have their own beliefs. But what I teach my son is that love is love, and we're all human beings."}

some idea what Boogaloo is but the give you a little backstory Tim pool six months ago was so anti-gun super lefty whatever and I said back then he's just playing it he's just doing it as it's marketing ratings thing nobody can be that stupid gotta stop saying that but uh you go on he do his shtick and do his stories and then he contradict himself and I'd be like a while back I did a video about people who will only go to the edge of the box but never look over the edge and Tim was the perfect example all the evidence would be there right up against the cardboard and you won't look over the edge it's too scary to look over the top of the box piece all that information together so you know what's really going on in the middle the Boogaloo boys so apparently it the left is terrified of these horrible Boogaloo people who want to take over the government and and they're all horrible white extremists supremists and all this other bullshit and I'm listening to this and I'm fucking laughing so you understand and they're all terrified of Civil War just you understand I understand the whole Boogaloo movement and I'm not one of them Boogaloo movement would be something more akin to patriots people who are sick and tired of crap going on in their country they will most likely be center right to right but not super far right these people would be more likely to know the Constitution backwards and forwards than a politician but they're sick and tired of the thermocline today is killer man from windy all day though but three percenters are a thing and the concept of three percent is it only took three percent of the population to overthrow the British in the country three percent tea partiers these guys are the next evolutionary extension except for the fact that they are just people who share the same opinion it's not Antifa it's not the clan these are just Americans who want America to go back to being America without a K understand what I'm saying here these are just people who are sick and tired of watching their country devolve every special interest group gets points over the guy who goes to work every day black lives matter is now a super thing and moron for busy apologizing for shit they never did the rainbow mafia and their strong arm tactics to get their shit put through well you know what well not every gay person is involved in pedophilia there's a large section of the rainbow mafia political movement that backs them you see this come up every now and again and the gay people freaking know it's not us I'm not a bugaloo guy so I can understand but the fact of the matter is this is what's going on here it is shit like this that has pushed the whole concept of bugaloo now pay attention because this is important the whole bugaloo thing is a sigh out being run on you maybe not you in particular but definitely being run on the Karens and the Ivans and the weak-minded sheeple of the planet the libertarians have a great expression we want to take over the government and leave you alone kind of look the bugaloo guys want to do too they want to take over the government restructure it back to the way it's supposed to be and then fuck back off to leave me alone land so the people leave them alone and I can back them to the wall on that no problems with that concept because that's the way it should be but as far as it's an organized movement of white supremacist Nazi racist KKK members and who hate America no no that is exactly not what it is just relax folks unless you have pink hair and wear a vagina hat and streach every time something happens run up to people in the street yell at them for not wearing a mask and do all the other things that are basically the other side up whether turning you into communists if you rat on your neighbors because that's what a good aparachik does then you got something to worry about the bugaloo boys it's a joke it's the next iteration of okay think of it that way ice cubes means fruity but this is stereo now this is all part of the plan sigh up don't fall for it you know those bugaloo guys might be your neighbors if they existed so I'm just gonna go with this I think the bugaloo man only comes for all the bed zoys and zurls who don't rat on your neighbors and wear their masks and eat their tofu kale rainbow maculado whatever the hell those frigging people eat they're not terrorists they're not even real fucking joke I gotta go inside now put my Hawaiian shirt and my pet will cure on and go to the meeting oh folks don't fall for this shit okay we're just terrorizing you for the frigging profit margin I'm gonna do headlights next but this was too funny I had to all right remember if you are gonna bugaloo can't press that Hawaiian shirts gotta have wrinkles in it make sure you match your Hawaiian camo to your environment I haven't had a laugh like that forever wait some premise do not want to take over the gun want to overthrow the

Wow What a statement that is good and rule this clip I mean, it's kind of it's high. It's a little it's hyperbole. It's hyperbole obviously, but I mean any Pro private sector free market pro-capitalist that that the specter of a of a Warner Sanders presidency is absolutely Horrifying well, I think to you. I think Joe Biden Would put us back into our place and the we're just talking about no I know but what about Warner Sanders if I would walk in would walk into any room with any world leader I say great to see you again great. He said that he's supposedly on off the record. He told some private sector Leaders that you know with me You don't have as much to worry about as you would with and then he gets hammered for that because the woke Left is like this guy is going to be in bed with you know what we we want growth in this country That's what that's what's produced jobs at the corporations that create the jobs. Yeah, that you can't worry about This is a famous Hubert Humphrey quote You can't worry about the working man and not worry about for whom he's going to work You got to be attentive to the fact that without growth We're fighting over a shrinking pot. So at the end of the day, you know, I'm supporting Joe with a whole heart Okay, and I will within this weekend I'm optimistic about how he can actually solve the problems facing our country and bring us together The best way as we were talking about earlier the best way for us to confront a peer competitor in China is to be America again To legislate to solve problems to deal with drug pricing the opening Do you sit alone at like you're sitting alone at lunch now?

Are you headed back there today? He said quote we cannot be the party of free stuff. That doesn't work Well, obviously it doesn't work and it's interesting to even see a Democrat agreeing with that Americans realize this and that's why everyone is hopefully not going to vote for whoever the Democratic nominee ends up being because There is no such thing as free stuff Everybody pays for it one way or the other whether it's increased taxes Whether it's taking from the taxpayers and giving it to the ones that aren't working or more than anything else Your freedom You're always gonna pay for it folks.

{"vid": "non_hate_video_158", "transcript": "Yeah, you know Joe Rogan is like dangerous his stupidity is kind of dangerous Oh, no, I you know, I know a lot of a lot of his hardcore fans are gonna be clicking on this And what's this guy gonna say about my buddy Joe man? Joe's fucking awesome man. He's better than you. What the fuck You know, he actually did this. I was trying to watch this. I got 54 minutes in this is how far I got in right last night I just had to keep on stopping like oh Jesus, okay I get it I have a degree in politics and I have to degrees in philosophy So a lot of the concepts are really easy for me But you know what I know they're easy for a lot of people to understand what double-speak is what new speak is to Understand the linguistic games being played by the left when you start watching this and thank God at least Andy Ngo got to tell like his side of the story pretty much ununder uninterrupted Thank God for the first ten minutes and then at the end of it you see Joe Well, this is all really confusing, you know, it's so confusing. It's so no it's not fucking confusing Joe It's confusing because you're trying to play the false center. It's confusing because you've got this false neutrality It's confusing to you because you're not fucking waking up and realizing that you're being manipulated by the left You don't even understand what fucking double-speak is you don't get that that and Tifa are actually pro fascist When I stopped watching it's when Joe Rogan said, you know keeps cutting fucking Andy I will can we get a definition of this and what do you mean by that and what do you mean by this like Joe thinks he's doing like The platonic method or is it the Socratic method where you ask people questions in order to make them realize that maybe their position is wrong But no, you're not doing it right Joe You're asking people questions because you legitimately don't know what the fuck they're talking about Which is so messed up to me because your buddy Jordan Peterson You've talked to him at length a lot of the things that you need to understand about how our world works and has been working Historically politically Conceptually you should have all that stuff in your head Joe, but you don't for some fucking reason is it the weed is it the cryotherapy? I don't know what's doing it to you But at this final point here of 54 minutes in and he says Jamie call up a definition of fascism And I say I can't watch this anymore, you know, okay. Yeah, yeah, mr. James Paus and with your three degrees Yeah, you understand all these concepts fuck off if you don't already have a basic grasp on what fascism means What are you gonna do? Oh Jamie? Could you call it up? What did they do? They called up fucking Wikipedia? They called up they typed into Google and they read the first fucking hit a Form of radical right wing authoritarian Ultranationalism characterized by dictatorial power force some of this is correct It is fascism is characterized by dictatorial power forcible suppression of opposition and strong Regimentation society that that's all true, but hey radical right wing not necessarily that is not a necessary Essential part of the definition of definition of fascism never was for some reason. Thank God. Mary and Webster still has the proper definition of Pretty close anyway a political philosophy movement or regimes such as that of fascista that exalts nation and often race above the individual Oh, but James it says nation that's intrinsically right wing Is it are you gonna tell me that Chinese communism for example? It does not exalt nation and race above the individual Are you gonna tell me that so no nationalism and Exalting the nation and being right wing are not intrinsically tied either if that's your only argument to say that fascism is intrinsically right wing That's a pretty fucking weak argument, but anyways anyways, I didn't actually keep watching. I didn't know that they did this I just saw somebody else mentioned it somebody else mentioned it that you know Joe Rogan is spreading around that fucking fake definition of fascism Do I have to tell you this? I'm sure most of you know this that gangs groups of people of leftist academics get together and edit Wikipedia articles That's how Wikipedia works anybody can come in through with a little bit of vetting and edit their articles I'm sure most of you know how unreliable Wikipedia is But maybe a lot of you don't and apparently Joe Rogan doesn't fucking get this and his idiot producer Jamie don't get this It's being used as a tool of new speak They're redefining things in order to change the way that people think if you change the way language works Then you change the way people's thoughts work if you change language you change people's thoughts that's something Understood by leftist. That's why so many leftist so-called historians and politicians alone They have degrees in linguistics and communications known Chomsky a linguistics professor Suddenly becomes a historian. He was never a true historian He was playing fucking games with ideas and language in order to change people's thinking to be further and further to the left and this process Continues and Joe Rogan somehow You think I keep on but they mean dog You fucking Joe Rogan it really pisses me off What a useful idiot he is and that he is such outreach 5.7 million people have watched this now So yeah, I don't know yo yo, he's kind of confusing. Oh what the Joe keep fucking saying also that really drove me nuts in the first 15 minutes 5050 minutes. Yeah, it's just a minority of people though. It's just a minority of people It's just the far the far far left of this and they're the only ones that are violent No, you fucking moron Joe Leftist ideology as it is now so-called extreme leftism, but which encompasses The majority of the left believes all authority flows from the barrel of a gun. This is something so Mount Satan said that Everybody all of their fucking people that they look up to all of the intellectuals like Karl Marx and Mount Satan and Lenin all the rest of them Understood or they believed anyways that no true revolution can come about without violence So no, it's not just a leader. Oh, it's just a minority It's just a minority of them even people in the comments are saying yo I live in Portland and Joe Rogan doesn't fucking understand It's not just a minority of them that are condoning violence In general they see their violence against the right as righteous because it's against the right and That's that and also don't you understand this concept that some people just want to see the world burn don't you understand how fucking lost and and sad and pathetic and and mentally damaged these new generations and Millennials are Though they inherit a lot of that from their boomer from their boomer forbearers And I'm not sure where generation X is in that but they're so angry about the state of affairs And they think that they're so hard done by because they've been taught in university They've been taught even in high school They've been taught even in grade school that they are victims they're victims they're victims and they want change and they want revolution And the only way we can have a revolution is through violence therefore. Yes, we will beat up on this gay Vietnamese man. Yes. Yeah, and then Joe says don't they realize that people are gonna see that and some you know right wingers They're gonna start picking up guns. Yeah, they do know that Joe. That's why they're doing it They're doing it because they want to escalate tensions. They want violence They want a violent conflagration because they believe that that that violence that chaos that anarchy is the fertile soil in which Progress can be had that's how the left thinks Yeah, buddy Jordan must have told you some of this shit Joe It's really confusing. It's really confusing fucking Joe Rogan man. Fuck me Let me give you all a piece of advice Next time you're in a thrift store and you see in old dictionary is the bigger the better and the older the better buy it Buy it and every once in a while check the fucking words and see how they're changing over time But James, that's the nature of language language naturally changes depending on people's usages It used to be that the world word literally actually meant Poetically, but for some people reason a lot of people started using it as if it meant Factually and now people are dead bent on trying to correct people who are actually using it the way that it used to be used But that's okay. I know a lot of you are confused by what I just said Yeah, literally actually was a figurative way of speaking in the past, but anyways, that's just an example But Language is no longer changing in a natural way. It's changing via social engineering Social engineering like these people that go on Wikipedia and change the articles and change the definitions and they omit information Just that video I did two days ago, but Jeffrey Epstein It turns out that they went to Bill Clinton's Wikipedia and they removed anything about Jeffrey Epstein There's all this stuff is going on. It's social engineering. That's not true Progress that's not true evolution of language. You're being manipulated Go to the thrift store and pick up a couple old dictionaries before 1980 preferably and the bigger the better. I Know I'm the only sort of person that reads dictionaries for fun, but trust me. It's worthwhile It's worth what and the other thing it don't maybe you should read the book 1984 and read the book I mean, I know a lot of you are probably tempted just to watch the movie But if you don't understand the concept of new speak, which I just finished talking about socially engineering Language in order to change the way people think intentionally and line with an ideology. That's new speak That's from 1984 if you haven't read George Orwell's 1984 Andy Ingoe brings up double speak the name at the font itself is perfect example of double speak It really is the yeah, they really are the exact opposite of what they say they are. They're not anti fascist They're very much fascists if you understand what they're going for and if you understand what the proper definition is I guess it does get kind of confusing if you're a fucking chimp, right? I guess it does get kind of confusing read 1984 Don't you know watch the movie after if you want but if you actually actually want to understand the concepts of new speak and double speak and and How you know the Ministry of Truth is this building where you go to be fucking tortured and you read it You'll see hey, that's what the left is doing No, it's not on both sides like Joe. I have you say well both sides are kind of guilty Oh, it's only just a little minority. Fuck you Joe. You know you so So fast oh god All right. All right read 1984 pick up an old dictionary and this fucking tool You know, I don't know what to say, you know, I tried to say something Joe doesn't understand the natty-foss intention is to escalate violence They want the right wing quote-unquote to pick up arms. They want things to get out of control. Look at that one like one like Thanks a lot for clicking a watch and check out my patreon and PayPal Linked in the description below and on this Korean right about now I do require one or two dollars and support every month from as many people as possible because a person like me who tells it like it is Has got no hope of gainful regular full-time employment in Canada So thanks a lot for clicking and watching and please please share sharing is so important right now Sharing is so important giving the way YouTube is throttling us. They're doing their third their part, too They're trying to disaparice down the memory hole. Please read 1984. All right. We'll talk to you again real soon. Have a nice weekend. Bye-bye folks"}

What are you seeing, what's going through your mind as you're witnessing this gigantic hoax? Let me just say again, what I said in 2016, there are honorable members of our intelligence, military, and civilian community in the government who understood exactly how corrupt Biden and the Democratic machinery is, was, and will be. This is really a sting operation, contrary to what everybody else said. Trump knew this was happening. Eric knew this was happening and warned the public. I knew this was happening. However, I could not say anything about it. What happened was we marked, watermarked every ballot with what's called the QFS Blockchain Encryption Code. In other words, we know pretty well where every ballot is, where it went, and who has it. So this is not a stolen election. On the contrary, we reversed the entire game of war along the lines of Sun Tzu, the art of war. And Trump was brilliant and still is brilliant at it. The reason he hasn't been seen and Alex correctly said, oh, I haven't seen him in several days. Well, in the art of the war, you pull back, allow your enemy to make all the mistakes that they are making, manipulate the situation, expose them, and then come in for the final killing. And that's what's happening now. None of this was unexpected. All of this was expected. All of this is part of the sting operation we're running. And let me tell you that 48 hours ago, not only did we put markets on those ballots, but I can say now, with the permission of people in the intelligence community and elsewhere, that we have sent out thousands and thousands of national guards to 12 different states, Washington, Delaware, Texas, Arizona, Alabama, and everywhere. So now you have to consider and rethink what this is really about. The genius of Trump is that he is able to pull back at any point and manipulate the opponent without the opponent ever realizing. He has said repeatedly, hashtag steal the vote. That's exactly what he has said for months. Then he made a very clear implication. He said, I will use common sense or my intelligence, i.e., both literal and figurative intelligence. And those of us in the intelligence community, be it who they are, again, what I said in 2016, when we exposed Hillary Clinton, we now exposed, and it was Trump who initiated this, Biden family, Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, Jill Biden, Jim Biden, Frank, the whole family who was played right into a game where they were convicted and you're seeing what's happening now. What was not announced was that we watermarked all the ballots with what I said, QFS blockchain, which is a very hard encryption code to break. And the second thing is we sent, as I probably 20,000 or more, our national guards 48 hours ago, none of it was reported. And I thank the press for not reporting it and others. So what in fact is happening is you're seeing a sophisticated sting operation that was initiated by Trump. I'm just a lowly peasant in this game. And honestly, I was informed that I could say something about it today only last night. That's why I could not come out. Well, you just a reverse of what you guys have been thinking. It's not a civil war. We have not been surprised in any way. This has been a setup by Trump for a long, long time. In the same way that we knew about Hillary Clinton, I warned about the coup that we would do it counter to. And this is our county to again, against the Bidens. And that's exactly what we expected. The corruption in the mail, the corruption of USPS, we corruption with the Democrats everywhere and anywhere. There was no surprise here. And that's why we deployed national guard soldiers to 12 different states. Steve, you've just broken certainly perhaps the biggest news since the election here on this show are arrests inevitably coming down the road. They're coming not just down the road. They're being implemented. What you saw Corey Wendowski and beyond the same when they were in Clay County and as well in Philadelphia, that was not just a threat. That was exactly what's going to happen. People will be arrested as of tonight, tomorrow, and it will go on for quite a while. And this was a total sting operation that I can say. So explain anybody else. Well, as I have the permission to say it, I do not deal with classified information. As you know, I do not work for our government, but because I'm loyal to the Republic and I work with a lot of people who are loyal to this Republic, including the 16 intelligence services, the Secret Service, our civilian service, they've all been great. And they've kept it quiet. And I've been given the permission to say what I just said. I have nothing more to say, but this is not a surprise here. This is the biggest sting operation probably in our country that we've ever had. So how is this watermark on the ballots? What is the significance of that as to is it going to stop from fake balance being counted or how is that going to be used? Well, we use it in any way that we need to use it in terms of counting, knowing which ones were fake, which ones were not. It's a very sophisticated code. So if you just throw them away, these are cyber communication implementations that we have the code for. We know exactly what was thrown away. We know exactly what was placed. We know exactly who has it, and we know exactly where it went. I can't go any further than that."}
